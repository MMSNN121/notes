How to make friends and influence people
    Find below some pointers on how to behave when addressing a conversation with someone. So far, mostly extracted from the book: How to make friends and influence people by Dale Carnegie.

    **Do no criticize, condemn or complain**; it makes you look bad. To teach something to someone, **punishment for bad behavior works worse than reward for good one**. Incentivize people. I.E a pilot almost dies because a mechanic used the wrong fuel for the plane. Instead of being mad at him, he tells the mechanic to service again the plane for tomorrow, that he is sure that it won't happen again.

    People desire to be great and important. **Give honest sincere appreciation**. It has to be honest otherwise people will notice. Appreciate and encourage people so that they feel better. **Mention his name during the conversation**, will make them feel important and will help you remember it. To make someone like you instantly, **tell something nice that you truly like about him**, something that you admire, it has, to be honest, sincere like a hair cut, shirt, ask about it.

    Smile when meeting / talking to someone, **be grateful**.
        Focus on what they want and need. Talk in terms of other people interests.
    If there is any one secret of success, is getting **other people point of view and see things from that person's angle** as well as from your own.

    Be an interested, honest, passionate listener.

    Do not interrupt if you get an idea when someone else is talking.

    **Encourage others to talk about themselves**. Always make the other person feel important.

    **Ask questions that they will enjoy answering**. Find out what their passion is and talk and ask questions about it.

    **A man convinced against his will, is of the same opinion still**. Never argue with someone even if you are right, you will make the other person feel bad. If you are right, then you have nothing to win.

    How to address an argument:
        Distrust your first reaction and analyze carefully the situation.
        Control your temper, be friendly.
        Listen first to the other people's point of view.
        Look for areas of agreement.
        Be honest look for areas where you thought wrong and accept their point.
        Tell them that you will think about the other points.
        Thank your opponent for their sincere points and postpone a meeting for another day.
        When you win an argument you just other peoples feelings. Don't say I am going to prove this and that, it seems you are saying you are smarter than them. Galileo said: You can not teach a man anything, you can help him to find it within himself.
        **Avoid telling people they are wrong**, when listening to someone do not judge as a first reaction, but instead try to understand him and empathize.
        **Accept your mistakes, criticize yourself**: If you did something wrong, they are more likely to forget it and forgive you.

    I.E: if you want your rent reduced rather than complaining and insulting the landlord tell him how much you like the apartment and tell him that you can not afford it anymore.

    **Avoid saying the word no**. Find points of agreement. Agree on the purpose if you don't agree on the method.

    **You have to make people say yes**, keep open attitude for our ultimate purpose.

    **Talk in terms of other people best interests**. Look at things from other people point of view, agree to view him and then change his mind by making him agree on you.

    **Put on other people's shoes**, how would I react if I were him?

    **Always exaggerate your guilt** tell how mad the other person must feel; that there is no excuse etc.

    Say I don't blame you for how you feel, If I were you I would feel exactly the same.

    To make people more efficient, simulate competition. I.E two shifts competing with each other to produce more, etc The desire of self-improvement to be challenged and to feel that you are worth, to the game and do interesting work makes people more efficient

    If you need something out of somebody begin with an honWest appreciation.

    **Call attention on people's mistakes indirectly**: To criticize people avoid using the word 'but'. I.E I like this but you should change that. Try saying instead I like this and if you continue working like this you will improve that. If the workers leave the garden dirty, clean it and pile all the trash on one side and call them telling that you are very happy with how they left it. The next morning they will leave it clean.

    Do not give orders to people, **make suggestions about how you would do something**, ask them if this approach would work, maybe it would be better if... etc That way they will save their pride and they will be more cooperative.

    Praise every improvement someone does, they will be happy you do so.


The Compound Effect
    **Have healthy habits**, it might take you years to achieve your goals but doing 10 actions a day towards that will help you to achieve it. The opposite for unhealthy habits (TV, fast food, etc..). Have exceptions but get a healthy routine.
    **Take ownership of your failures**: no matter what happens to you, take responsibility for it. You are freed by your choices.

    **Track actions taken to achieve or to fail a goal**: It helps to focus on the problem and makes you aware of those actions.

    Invest early: Compound effect will make your money grow. Every dollar you spend and not invest is 5-10 dollars you lose in 10 years time.

    Replace bad behavior habits with healthier ones. Identify them first. For example, drink carbonated water instead of cola. Find money you waste every month (Netflix, insurance, Starbucks), does it really give you happiness? Change the habit.

    **What motivates you is the ignition of your passion**. You need to identify what you want to achieve to make a difference this time and not fail like the other ones. The power of why makes you stick to the habits. Otherwise, you will revert to sleepwalking through poor choices

    **Taking actions that align with your core values will make you happy**. If you hang out with people with different values you won't we happy.

*Goals = choice + behaviour(action) + habit(repeat) + compounded(time)*

    Identify behaviors leading to that goal and the ones blocking you from achieving it. People fit have good gym habits, people thin have good food habits, etc...

    Monitor how much time you spend watching tv, reading the news etc and change habits. News tend to be negative and depressing, avoid 	spending too much time on them.

    If you tell friends or people about your goals and tracking you are more likely to commit to them due to social pressure

    Competition also helps to stick to the habits, get your friends or coworkers to work with you


You are a BadAss

    You need to stop wanting to do something and start doing something about it

    And the day come when the risk to remain tight in a bud was more painful than the risk it took to blossom

    If you want to live a life you've never lived, you have to do things you've never done.

    Most people are living in an illusion based on someone else's beliefs. You have been raised by your family and your thinking is influenced by it, society has many expectations that are not necessarily going to give you happiness.

    (not such a good book, gave up on it).


Happiness
*Happiness = Health + Wealth + Wisdom*

*Health = Exercise + Diet + Sleep
    Exercise = High Intensity Training + Cardio + Regularity
    Diet = Natural Foods + Occasional Fasting + Plants
    Sleep = 7-9 Hours of Sleep + Circadian Rhythm*

*Wealth = Savings + Investments + Assets
    Savings = 10-20% Monthly Income * ROI
    Investments = 10-20% Monthly Income * ROI
    Assets = Estate Property + Intellectual Property + Skills*

*Wisdom = Knowledge + Experience + Tranquility
    Knowledge = Books + Lateral Thinking + Intellectual Curiosity
    Experience = Travel + Friends + Get out of comfort zone
    Tranquility = Self-control + Introspection + Perspective*

    Habits to change
        When you want to go shopping, go decluttering instead.
        When you want to eat garbage, eat green things instead.
        When you want to stay up late watching tv, go to sleep instead.
        When you want to argue with strangers on the internet, create something instead.
        When you want to look at social media, read a book instead.

    Good habits
        don't judge
        slow down
        pay attention
        be kind
        mediate
        sleep
        eat well
        laugh often
        breath consciously
        pamper yourself
        don't worry
        choose time over money

    Free time management
        The key to time management is prioritization
        I don't have time = it's not a priority
        Stop deleting emails, do first what matters, run a todo list
        Prioritize

    Personal Growth
        Passive Income
        Learn a new skill
        Discover a new place
        Have good friends, be close to them, help them.
        Meet someone new
        Be fit

    75 years study on happiness found:
        People living in a marriage without affection had worse health, unhappiness and died younger
        People more satisfied with their relationships in the 50s, where healthier in the 90s.
        People in bad relationships reported more pain in bad days.
        People who feel can count on their partners have sharper memory when they get older.
        People happiest in retirement, were the ones that worked had actively worked to replace workmates with friends.


    Alternate learning zone and performance zone
        **Learning zone** goal is to improve, concentrate on things we have not mastered, mistakes are expected. Maximizes growth. Good for long run.  Try out new strategies, ask questions,
        **Performance zone** do as best as we can, activities for execution, concentrate on activities we have mastered.

    Pillars of meaning
        **Seeking happiness causes unhappiness** Having the perfect job, boyfriend and apartment won't bring happiness
        **Belonging** being in relationships were you are valued for what you are or believe.
        **Find purpose** Use your strength to help others (maybe through work). You need something worthwhile to do, you need something to drive you forward,
        **Transcendence** experiences that make you loose sense of time (maybe programming)
        **Story telling** Creating a narrative of events of your life helps you to find purpose growth and purpose

    Things to avoid:
        Do not say 'like'
        Do not apologize for everything
        Do not eat too quick
        Do not focus conversations on you
        Do not talk too loud
        Do not interrupt people
        No nail biting

    What is you grandmother's name? You probably don't even know. In two generations no one will remember anything about you. Your actions do not matter in grand scheme of things. Stop worrying about what people will think or what is social acceptable, do what you want to do before it's too late.

    **Lemons market** The buyers know more about the product than the buyer (like used cars), the cheaper product wins.

Awaken the Giant within
    The hardest step in achieving anything is making a true commitment.
    The most successful people make decisions quickly because they are clear on their values and what they want.
    The more decisions you make the better you're going to become at making them.
    Learn from your decisions. Failure is necessary and we can learn from it.
    Make More decisions to learn and make better ones in the future. Decision making gets better the more you do it.
    Stay committed to your ideas but with a flexible approach.
    Enjoy making decisions, decisions you make might change the course of your life forever.
    Everything people do is to avoid pain or to get pleasure.
    Do not try to change your behavior, understand it to take better decisions.
    Sometimes you know you should do something but you don't because it will bring temporary pain until not taking action is more painful than taking it. This is the emotional threshold.
    A man who suffers before it's necessary suffers more than it's necessary.
    The secret of success is learning how to use pain and pleasure instead of having pain and pleasure use you. If you do that, you're in control of your life. If you don't, life controls you.
    We are driven to avoid pain and to get pleasure, find out what motivates you, what brings you joy and focus your objectives on that. For instance, drug addicts link pleasure to drugs, Donald Trump to be more powerful, and Mother Teresa to help others. They are driven by this. Think what is pain and please experiences that shaped your life.
    We make neuro-associations of pain and pleasure. For instance, seeing a drunk family member when you are young will make you not want to try alcohol. You can use these experiences to shape and teach your children.
    We are not driven much by what we intellectually know but by what we learned to link pain and pleasure to.
    Put aside passing moments of terror and temptation, and focus on what's most important in he long term, your values and personal standards
    Look for a mentor in each aspect of life: relationships, finances, health etc someone with more experience.
    There are three things we can control in our life: what we focus on, what things mean and what to do in spite of our challenges.


The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck
    Our culture is obsessively focused on **unrealistically positive expectations**: be richer, happier, healthier, smarter, perfect job, more popular, more admired...
    All self-help guidance is fixation on what you lack.
    **The smallest dog barks the loudest**: A confident man does not need to prove that he's confident. A rich woman does not need to convince anyone that she is rich. If you dream about something all the time you reinforce the same unconscious reality: you are not that.
    The world is constantly telling us to buy more, be more, make more, own more, etc
    The key to a good life is not giving a fuck about more, it's giving a fuck about less, only about what is try and immediate and important.
    Everyone has flat TV, expensive phone, even groceries delivered. **Our crisis is no longer material but existential**. there are infinite amount of things we can now see and any number of ways we can discover that we don't measure up.
    The desire for a more positive experience is itself a negative experience.
    The acceptance of one's negative experience is itself a positive experience
    The richer you want to be the poorer you become, the sexier you want to be the uglier you feel.
    The less you care about something the better you will become at it.
    Not giving a fuck is to stare at life's terrifying challenges and take action.
    The moments of non-fucker are the moments that most define our lives: switch in careers, dropping out of college, join a rock band, dump your girlfriend... **Not giving a fuck is to stare life's most terrifying challenges and take action**.
    You have to learn to pick what matters to you based on your values and focus on that.
    You must give a fuck about something, it's in our biology.
    If you find yourself consistently giving too many fucks about trivial shit such as mouse batteries dying too quickly, your ex profile picture, etc.. It's because you don't have much going on in your life to give a legitimate fuck about and that is your real problem. If you have no problems, the mind finds a way to invent some.
    Maturity is learning to give a fuck about what's truly fuckworthy.
    Accept life, care about family, friends and personal goals.
    Problems never stop, they just get upgraded/changed: Happiness comes from solving problems. If you avoid them, then you're going to make yourself miserable. If you feel you can't solve your problems you will feel miserable. The secret is to learn how to solve the problems.
    Nobody actually happy has to stand in front of a mirror and tell himself that he's happy. Do not deny your problems or concerns. Exercises that make you feel good short term are useless and generate addiction.
    What pain do you want to sustain? A path to happiness is a path of shitheaps and shame.
    Who you are is defined by what you're willing to struggle for. If you enjoy the struggles of a gym, you can run triathlons. You can't win if you don't play.
    A true measure of self-worth is not how a person feels about her positive experiences, but about negative ones. A person with high self-worth can look at himself and say: Yes, sometimes I am irresponsible with money, and I should improve it. Entitled people are incapable of acknowledging their problems and are left chasing high after high accumulating deny, until reality hits.
    Because of the Internet, TV and social media, we think that **exceptionalism is the new normal**. Because of the people is average, we feel insecure and not good enough. We cope with this either with self-aggrandizing or other-aggrandizing (get rich quick scheme, saving starving babies in Africa, getting good marks, having sex with everyone...).
    Technology and mass marketing is screwing up people's expectations of themselves, there is a culture of exceptionalism.
    Your actions don't matter that much in the grand scheme of things, your life will be not noteworthy and that is ok.
    You should find appreciation for ordinary things: simple friendship, creating something, helping a person in need, reading a book, laughing with someone you care...
    Suffering is inevitable, problems of life are unavoidable, but you can choose what to suffer about. There was a Japanese soldier that was told to defend a jungle, he did not know the war had finished and continued killing civilians for 20 years after the war. He was told after that and came back to Japan. He was eating worms in the jungle for 20 years but happy to fight for a greater cause. When he came back society was just nerds and he got depressed. Another guy went to look for the Yeti and died but was happy to do something meaningful.
    The onion of self-awareness
        First layer: Understanding one's emotions. This is when I feel happy, this makes me feel sad, this gives me hope. Expressing emotions and understand them is difficult.
        Second layer: Ask why we feel certain emotions. Why do I feel angry? Is it because I failed to achieve a goal? Why people feel uninspired? They illuminate what we consider success or failure.
        Third level: Personal values, Why do I consider this to be a success/failure? How I am choosing to measure myself? What standard I am measuring myself and people around me? (very difficult to do). These values determine the nature of our problems and the quality of our life. Why do you feel the need to be rich in the first place? If people are unhappy is because of a particular value and not the fact they don't drive a Bentley.
    Honest self-questioning is difficult. It requires asking yourself simple questions that are uncomfortable to answer. Think about what is bugging you, then why. Chances are it is a failure of some sort. Then take that failure and ask why it seems true to you. Has it been a failure? Maybe you are looking at it the wrong way: Maybe I don't need to be close to my brother to have a good relationship that I value. Maybe just mutual respect and mutual trust. Maybe these metrics are better than how many text messages do we exchange. Not having a close relationship is fine. We get to control what our problems mean based on how we choose to think about them and measure them.
    Comparing ourselves with others rather than without standards it's a mistake and will make us unhappy (I.E Dave Mustaine vs Metallica and the Beattle that got kicked and happy with his family).
    If you want to change how you see your problems, you have to change what you value and how you measure success and failure.
    Shitty values
        **Pleasure**: Pleasure is a horrible value to prioritize. People who focus their energy on superficial pleasures end up more anxious, more emotionally unstable and depressed.
        **Material success**: Some people measure their success on how much money they make, what car they drive or if the front lawn is greener and prettier than next door. Once basic physical needs are provided, the correlation between happiness and worldly success approaches to zero. Prioritizing material success over other values, such as honesty, nonviolence, compassion is a mistake.
        **Always being right**: Our brains are inefficient machines. We constantly make poor assumptions, misjudge, misremember facts, make decisions based on emotional whims. We are wrong pretty much constantly. If your metric for success is being right, it will prevent you from learning from your mistakes, empathize with others. It is more helpful to assume that you're ignorant and don't know a lot. This keeps you unattached to superstitious or poorly informed beliefs and promotes constant state of learning and growth.
        **Staying positive** There are people who measure their lives by the ability to be positive about everything (lost job, parent dead, husband cheated, etc...) Sometimes life sucks and it's ok to admit it. Constant positivity is a form of avoidance, not a solution of life's problems. Things go wrong, people upset us and accidents happen. This makes us feel bad and it's ok. Negative emotions are a necessary component of emotional health, deny negativity is to perpetuate problems rather than solving them. We need to express problems in a socially acceptable manner and in a way that aligns with our values.
    Completing a marathon, raising a child or starting a business with our friends is going to give us lot's of problems to solve, but much more meaning and happiness in the long term than buying a new PC, finishing a video game, eating chocolate, etc...
    "One day, in retrospect, th years of struggle will strike you as the most beautiful" by Freud.
    Pleasure, material success, always being right and positiveness are poor ideas for a person's life. Some of the best moments of one's life are not pleasant, not material, not successful, not known and not positive.
    The points to nail down some good values and metrics. Pleasure and success will naturally emerge as a result.

    **Defining good values**
        Good values are reality based, socially constructive, immediate and controllable.
        Bad values are superstitious, socially destructive and not immediate or controllable.
        For example: Honest is a good value (it's something you have complete control over, it reflects reality and benefits others even if it is unpleasant). Popularity is a bad value. If being the most popular in the dance is important, much of what happens will be out of control (you don't know who else is in the party, or who they are. The metric is not real, you feel popular/unpopular but you don't know what other people think.
        Examples of healthy values: honesty, innovation, vulnerability, standing up for oneself or others, self-respect, curiosity, charity, humility, creativity. These values can be achieved internally. Bad values rely on external events.
        Everyone wants a private jet, the question is your priorities and what influences your decisions making. I.E Hiroo Onoda's loyalty to Japanese empire.
        This is **what self improvement is about**, prioritizing better values choosing better things to give a fuck about. Better problems mean better life.

    We are always taking an active role in what's occurring to and within us, interpreting the meaning of every moment and occurrence. We are always choosing what values we live and metrics by which we measure everything that happens to us.
    **Accepting responsibility for our problems is the first step to solve them**. I.E. A man is too short. Even though he is intelligent, interesting and good looking. Because he thinks he is too short, we does not go out and does not try to meet women. This is a crappy value: Not being tall enough. A better value would have been I want to date women who like me for who I am.

    We are responsible for experiences that aren't our fault all the time, this is part of life. We need to take responsibility of our own emotions. Blaming other for how you feel will only hurt yourself.
    **Victimhood Chic**: The responsibility/fault fallacy allow people to pass off the responsibility for solving their problems to others. This gives a temporary high blaming other people and a feeling of moral righteousness.
    **Outrage porn**: Rather than reporting real stories of real problems, the media finds a problem mildly offensive, broadcasts it to some audience, generate outrage, then broadcast that outrage back to the population to outrage another part of the population. This triggers an echo of bullshit pinging back and forth between two imaginary sides, distracting everyone from real problems.

    People gets addicted to feeling offended all the time because it gives them a high, self-righteous and morally superior feeling.

    Our values are imperfect and incomplete. This openness to being wrong must exist for real change or growth to take place.



Sharpen the saw
    Working smarter, not harder: Besides allowing you to get more done, regularly making time to take care of yourself also increases your sense of agency and effectiveness.
    When it comes to our personal lives, we should focus on four domains: physical, spiritual, mental, and social/emotional.
    All of these dimensions are interconnected. If we feel good physically, we have mental clarity and better control of our emotions. If our social life is good, we'll have more motivation and energy to take care of ourselves physically. And because these human domains are interconnected, it allows us to synergize them which will enable you to do more in less time (more on that below).


The Compound Effect
    *Routines* are important. Soldiers are trained with routines, so even with the imminent threat of death, they can carry out their duties with precision in the middle of the chaos of combat.

    Get used to *journaling*, summarize what you achieved at the end of the day, what went well and not so well, any ideas you had or thoughts, what is worth doing tomorrow.

    Doing the same things week after week will stop showing compounded results (i.e. change workout) mix it up, challenge yourself in new ways.

    Consider adding more adventure to your life: eating different kinds of food, taking a class, visiting a new place, meet new people helps you feel alive.

    You should design your morning and evening routines in a journal.

    Pick 3 things you are not satisfied with your life and you want to improve, write 20 actions you could do to improve them.

    You are 100% responsible for your life and your choices.

    Your brain is not designed to make you happy. Your brain has only one agenda in mind: survival. It is designed to seek out negative resources. Avoid watching the news. You should protect what you feed to your mind.

    Commercials are designed to make you feel bad about yourself unless you buy things you don't need.

    **News and magazines have no bearing in your personal life and goals**, dreams or ambitions. Use RSS or twitter to filter what you care.

    People who you usually associate are called reference group. A lot of your success is determined by them. We become the combined average of the five people we hang around the most. The people whom we spend our time determine what conversations dominate our attention and opinions we are exposed, our ambitions, our habits, etc...

    To improve in an area, you can find an accountability partner who tries to achieve the same goals, to share the pain and motivate each other. Or find a mentor and have a weekly call of 30 mins.

The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People
    **Overview**. We have two mental maps, the map that shows how we see things and the one that shows how things should be. When we describe what we see, we in effect describe how we see ourselves, our perceptions and our paradigms. When someone disagrees with us, we think something is wrong with them. Each looks through the unique lens of experience.
    Principles are guidelines for human conduct, values are maps that people decide to use for guidance.
    Admission of ignorance is the first step in our education.
    **Habit** is the intersection of knowledge, skill, and desire. This is what to do, how to do it and wanting to do it. You need the three.
    Happiness can be defined as the fruit of the desire and ability to sacrifice what we want now for what we want eventually.
    The following habits are aimed at improving efficiency to maximize long term benefit and growth.
    **p** is production and **p/c** production capability. You need to find and keep an **optimal P/PC balance** for efficiency growth.
    Our most important financial asset is our own capacity to earn. Invest in improving your p/c.
    P/PC can be seen in software development as technical debt.
    **Habit 1: Be proactive**. Self-awareness is the ability to think about your thought process. It enables us to examine the way we see ourselves and others.
    A lot of what we are is determined by three factors: **genetic determinism** determined in our DNA, **psychic determinism** or childhood friends and parents, and **environmental determinism** which is your spouse, boss, and economic situation.
    Proactively is taking initiative, being responsible for our own lives, making things happen.
    Reactive people is affected by weather, they build their emotional lives around the behaviour of others, empowering the weaknesses of others to control them. They are driven by feelings, circumstances and affected by their environment.
    Proactive people are driven by values carefully thought about, selected and internalized. Proactive people is still influenced by external stimuli but their response is value-based.
    Gandhi: They can not take away our self respect if we don't give it to them.
    It is not what happens to us that hurts us, but our response.
    Proactive people focus their efforts in the **Circle of influence**. They work on the things they can do something about.
    Reactive people focus their efforts on their **Circe of concern**: on the weaknesses of other people, problems in the environment, and circumstances you cannot control, victimization, reactive language.
    Problems can be classified in three categories: **Direct control** problems: they involve our own behaviour and we can solve them by working on our habits. **Indirect control** problems: involve other people's behaviour and you can fix by changing our methods of influence, and **No control** problems which we can not do anything about, like past situations, which we have to smile and learn to live with them.
    The **have's** and **be's**: The circle of concern is filled with the have's (I'll be happy when I have my house paid off, if I had a more patient husband, if I had more free time...). The circle of influence is filled with be's: I can be more patient, wiser, be more loving.
    Every time we think the problem is out there, that thought is the problem. We empower what's out there to control us.
    We are totally free to choose our actions, but not the consequences of those. The proactive approach is to immediately acknowledge **mistakes**, learn from those and correct it in the future. Reactive people will justify it, deceive it and rationalize it to self and others, giving it disproportionate importance, causing deeper injury to self and others.
    The response to any mistake affects the quality of the next movement. It is important to admit it and correct it quickly so it does not have power on the next movement and we are empowered again.
    The **commitments** we make and the integrity to those is the essence and clearest manifestation of our proactivity.
    The power to make and keep commitments to ourselves is the essence of developing the basic habits of effectiveness.
    We are responsible for our own effectiveness, happiness, and most of our circumstances.

    **Habit 2: Begin with the end in mind**
    If this were your funeral and your relatives and friends where making a speech, what'd you like them to say? what type of person would you like their words to reflect? what character would you like them to have seen in you? what achievements? what to remember?
    If the ladder is not leaning against the right wall, very step we take gets us to the wrong place faster.
    **Personal mission statement** or philosophy or creed. It focuses on what you want to be (character) and to do (achievements) and values or principles  in which those are based. Example
    Succeed at home first. Never compromise with honesty. Hear both sides before judging. Defend those who are absent. Be sincere and decisive. Develop a new proficiency every year. Plan tomorrow's work today. Keep sense of humor. Be orderly in person and at work. Do not fear mistakes. Maintain positive attitude. I will try to keep myself free from addictive and destructive habits. Money will be my servant not my master. Seek FI. Use money to make life more enjoyable.
    People have **centers** in which people focuses: **Spouse**, **Family**: growth from family traditions. **Money**: economic security. **Work**: workaholics sacrifice other things in life. **Possession**: physical but also intangible like fame glory. **Pleasure**: we live in a world where instant gratification is available and encouraged. **Friend enemy**: belonging to a peer group. **Church**. **Self centeredness**.

    **Habit 3: But first things first**
    Effective time management if putting first things first. Leadership decides what first things are, management puts them first.
    **Time management matrix**: an activity can be defined in terms of **urgent** and **important**.
    Urgent things act on us (a phone ringing), they press on us, insist on action, easy to do. Often they are also unimportant.
    Important things will involve results and are related to your mission, values and high priority goals.
    We **react** to urgent matters. Important matters require initiative and proactivity.
    **Quadrant 1** are tasks urgent and important (putting out fires). They drive our lives. We want to reduce those. They lead to stress, burnout. It is important to correctly categorize the tasks from Q1 and Q3 (not important).
    **Quadrant 2** is the heart of effective time management. It deals with things that are not urgent but important. I.E building relationships, writing a personal mission statement, exercising, preventive maintenance. What things could you do regularly that would have a tremendous positive difference in your life? Also, spending time on preventing activities in Q2 will also reduce tasks of Q1.
    You need to plan the activities of Q2 according to your values and mission statement. This will cause natural inclination towards doing those and not spending time on Q3 and Q4.
    Activities in Q2 increase your production and production capability.
    Your planning methodology should take into account: **Coherence** with your mission statement, roles, goals, desires and discipline. **Balance**: in your life, to not neglect important areas or roles. Think about two goals you want to achieve for each role. **Q2 focus**: Your methodology should move you into Q2. **Flexibility**: your planning tool should adapt to you. If should be **portable**
    Organize on weekly basis.
    Do not prioritize what's in your schedule but schedule your priorities.
    Emotional Bank account is a metaphor that describes the amount of trust that's been built up in a relationship.
    Seeking to understand another person is one of the most important deposits you can make.
    Making something important for another person important to you is a good deposit.
    Small discourtesies, little unkindness and disrespect makes large withdrawals. Little things mean big things.
    The cause of almost all relationship difficulties is rooted in conflicting or ambiguous expectations around roles and goals.
    One of the most important ways to manifest integrity is to **be loyal to those who are not present**. In doing so, we build the trust of those who are present. When you defend those who are absent, you retain the trust of those present.
    **I really shouldn't be saying this** makes a massive withdrawn to the person present as shows you can not be trusted.
    **Integrity** you should treat everyone with the same set of principles.

    **Habit 4: Think win/win**: Win/Win is a frame of mind and heart that constantly seeks mutual benefit in all human interactions. Agreements/solutions are mutually beneficial and satisfying. All parties feel committed to the action plan and good about the decision. Win/Win sees like as a cooperative not competitive arena.
    **Win/Lose mentality** is used when one child is compared to another. It lies on competition not cooperation. Like school, law.
    **Lose/win** is a paradigm with no expectations, standards, demands or vision. Little courage to express their own feelings and are intimidated by ego strength of others. They bury feelings and have disproportionate range or anger, overreaction to provocations. This affects relationships with others.
    **Win/win or no deal** if no solution for both is reached, we walk away.
    Win/Win performance agreements can have four types of rewards managers or parents can provide: psychic (recognition...) financial. opportunity (training), responsibility.
    **Habit 5: Take time to understand** first, is important in empathic communication. Take time to understand the other before trying to get them to understand you.
    There are **four types of listening**: Ignoring: not listening at all. Pretending: "yeah, huh-huh, right". Selective listening: hear only parts of the conversation. Attentive listening: Paying attention and focusing our energy on the words being said. **Empathic listening**: listening with intent to understand. The essence is not to agree with someone; but to understand emotionally and intellectually the other person. 60% is body language. Do not listen with your autobiography and assuming your thoughts. Diagnose before you prescribe.
    If someone replies with logical answers you can keep pushing, if they become emotional back off and try to understand.
    The vision of the world is very limited by our experiences. We suffer from shortage of data. Appreciate interacting with other points of view. These differences add to your knowledge. Value the difference in other people, do not take insults personally.

    **Habit 7: Sharpen the saw**: is personal PC. it's renewing and exercising regularly the four dimensions of your nature: physical, spiritual, mental and social/emotional.
    Sharpening the saw is a Q2 activity. We have to make it a healthy addiction.
    **Physical dimension** involves eating well, getting the right sleep&relaxation, and exercising regularly. Exercising is a Q2 activity, and not doing it lets to Q1 health problems.
    **Mental dimension**: Some people stop studying when they finish school and spend their time watching TV. Practice habit 3 and spend less time on things that do not produce P or PC.
    Writing is a powerful way to sharpen the saw. Keep journal of thoughts, experiences, insights, leanings promotes mental clarity, exactness and context.
    Organizing and planning represents other forms of mental renewal associated with Habits 2 and 3.
    **Social/Emotional dimension**: Integrity is the most fundamental source of personal worth. Long healthy life is the result of making contributions, having meaningful projects that are personally exciting and contributing to bless the lives of others.
    Treat a man as he is and he will remain as he is, treat a man as he can be and he will become what he can be.
    The more proactive you are (habit 1), the more effectively you can exercise personal leadership (habit 2) and management (habit 3), the more Q2 activities you do (habit 7) the more you seek first to understand (habit 5), the more effectively you can find synergetic win/win solutions (habit 4 and 6).
    True financial independence relies on  continuing your education, your power to produce, to learn, create, adapt, wealth is intrinsic.
    Spending one hour a day to renew your physical and spiritual and mental dimensions is the key to the development of the 7 habits.
    Choose purpose and principles to live by; otherwise the vacuum will be filled and we will lose our self-awareness. Learn, commit, do, repeat.
    Struggle is worthwhile and fulfilling. It gives meaning to life and enabled to love, serve and try again.

Rich Dad, Poor Dad
    **Rat race**: Working for your salary, increasing your expenses/taxes when your salary goes up and being stuck in this cycle.
    Education is the foundation of success.
    The reason the rich get richer, the poor poorer and the middle class strugles is because the subject of money is taught at home, not in school.
    Saying 'I can't afford it' makes your brain stop thinking. Saying 'how can I afford it' makes it think
