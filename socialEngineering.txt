How to win friends and influence people
    Find below some pointers on how to behave when addressing a conversation with someone. So far, mostly extracted from the book: How to make friends and influence people by Dale Carnegie.

    **Do no criticize, condemn or complain**; it makes you look bad. To teach something to someone, **punishment for bad behavior works worse than reward for good one**. Incentivize people. I.E a pilot almost dies because a mechanic used the wrong fuel for the plane. Instead of being mad at him, he tells the mechanic to service again the plane for tomorrow, that he is sure that it won't happen again.

    People desire to be great and important. **Give honest sincere appreciation**. It has to be honest otherwise people will notice. Appreciate and encourage people so that they feel better. **Mention his name during the conversation**, will make them feel important and will help you remember it. To make someone like you instantly, **tell something nice that you truly like about him**, something that you admire, it has, to be honest, sincere like a hair cut, shirt, ask about it.

    Smile when meeting / talking to someone, **be grateful**.
        Focus on what they want and need. Talk in terms of other people interests.
    If there is any one secret of success, is getting **other people point of view and see things from that person's angle** as well as from your own.

    Be an interested, honest, passionate listener.

    Do not interrupt if you get an idea when someone else is talking.

    **Encourage others to talk about themselves**. Always make the other person feel important.

    **Ask questions that they will enjoy answering**. Find out what their passion is and talk and ask questions about it.

    **A man convinced against his will, is of the same opinion still**. Never argue with someone even if you are right, you will make the other person feel bad. If you are right, then you have nothing to win.

    How to address an argument:
        Distrust your first reaction and analyze carefully the situation.
        Control your temper, be friendly.
        Listen first to the other people's point of view.
        Look for areas of agreement.
        Be honest look for areas where you thought wrong and accept their point.
        Tell them that you will think about the other points.
        Thank your opponent for their sincere points and postpone a meeting for another day.
        When you win an argument you just other peoples feelings. Don't say I am going to prove this and that, it seems you are saying you are smarter than them. Galileo said: You can not teach a man anything, you can help him to find it within himself.
        **Avoid telling people they are wrong**, when listening to someone do not judge as a first reaction, but instead try to understand him and empathize.
        **Accept your mistakes, criticize yourself**: If you did something wrong, they are more likely to forget it and forgive you.

    I.E: if you want your rent reduced rather than complaining and insulting the landlord tell him how much you like the apartment and tell him that you can not afford it anymore.

    **Avoid saying the word no**. Find points of agreement. Agree on the purpose if you don't agree on the method.

    **You have to make people say yes**, keep open attitude for our ultimate purpose.

    **Talk in terms of other people best interests**. Look at things from other people point of view, agree to view him and then change his mind by making him agree on you.

    **Put on other people's shoes**, how would I react if I were him?

    **Always exaggerate your guilt** tell how mad the other person must feel; that there is no excuse etc.

    Say I don't blame you for how you feel, If I were you I would feel exactly the same.

    To make people more efficient, simulate competition. I.E two shifts competing with each other to produce more, etc The desire of self-improvement to be challenged and to feel that you are worth, to the game and do interesting work makes people more efficient

    If you need something out of somebody begin with an honWest appreciation.

    **Call attention on people's mistakes indirectly**: To criticize people avoid using the word 'but'. I.E I like this but you should change that. Try saying instead I like this and if you continue working like this you will improve that. If the workers leave the garden dirty, clean it and pile all the trash on one side and call them telling that you are very happy with how they left it. The next morning they will leave it clean.

    Do not give orders to people, **make suggestions about how you would do something**, ask them if this approach would work, maybe it would be better if... etc That way they will save their pride and they will be more cooperative.

    Praise every improvement someone does, they will be happy you do so.


The Compound Effect
    **Have healthy habits**, it might take you years to achieve your goals but doing 10 actions a day towards that will help you to achieve it. The opposite for unhealthy habits (TV, fast food, etc..). Have exceptions but get a healthy routine.
    **Take ownership of your failures**: no matter what happens to you, take responsibility for it. You are freed by your choices.

    **Track actions taken to achieve or to fail a goal**: It helps to focus on the problem and makes you aware of those actions.

    Invest early: Compound effect will make your money grow. Every dollar you spend and not invest is 5-10 dollars you lose in 10 years time.

    Replace bad behavior habits with healthier ones. Identify them first. For example, drink carbonated water instead of cola. Find money you waste every month (Netflix, insurance, Starbucks), does it really give you happiness? Change the habit.

    **What motivates you is the ignition of your passion**. You need to identify what you want to achieve to make a difference this time and not fail like the other ones. The power of why makes you stick to the habits. Otherwise, you will revert to sleepwalking through poor choices

    **Taking actions that align with your core values will make you happy**. If you hang out with people with different values you won't we happy.

*Goals = choice + behaviour(action) + habit(repeat) + compounded(time)*

    Identify behaviors leading to that goal and the ones blocking you from achieving it. People fit have good gym habits, people thin have good food habits, etc...

    Monitor how much time you spend watching tv, reading the news etc and change habits. News tend to be negative and depressing, avoid 	spending too much time on them.

    If you tell friends or people about your goals and tracking you are more likely to commit to them due to social pressure

    Competition also helps to stick to the habits, get your friends or coworkers to work with you


You are a BadAss

    You need to stop wanting to do something and start doing something about it

    And the day come when the risk to remain tight in a bud was more painful than the risk it took to blossom

    If you want to live a life you've never lived, you have to do things you've never done.

    Most people are living in an illusion based on someone else's beliefs. You have been raised by your family and your thinking is influenced by it, society has many expectations that are not necessarily going to give you happiness.

    (not such a good book, gave up on it).


Happiness
*Happiness = Health + Wealth + Wisdom*

*Health = Exercise + Diet + Sleep
    Exercise = High Intensity Training + Cardio + Regularity
    Diet = Natural Foods + Occasional Fasting + Plants
    Sleep = 7-9 Hours of Sleep + Circadian Rhythm*

*Wealth = Savings + Investments + Assets
    Savings = 10-20% Monthly Income * ROI
    Investments = 10-20% Monthly Income * ROI
    Assets = Estate Property + Intellectual Property + Skills*

*Wisdom = Knowledge + Experience + Tranquility
    Knowledge = Books + Lateral Thinking + Intellectual Curiosity
    Experience = Travel + Friends + Get out of comfort zone
    Tranquility = Self-control + Introspection + Perspective*

    Habits to change
        When you want to go shopping, go decluttering instead.
        When you want to eat garbage, eat green things instead.
        When you want to stay up late watching tv, go to sleep instead.
        When you want to argue with strangers on the internet, create something instead.
        When you want to look at social media, read a book instead.

    Good habits
        don't judge
        slow down
        pay attention
        be kind
        mediate
        sleep
        eat well
        laugh often
        breath consciously
        pamper yourself
        don't worry
        choose time over money

    Free time management
        The key to time management is prioritization
        I don't have time = it's not a priority
        Stop deleting emails, do first what matters, run a todo list
        Prioritize

    Personal Growth
        Passive Income
        Learn a new skill
        Discover a new place
        Have good friends, be close to them, help them.
        Meet someone new
        Be fit

    75 years study on happiness found:
        People living in a marriage without affection had worse health, unhappiness and died younger
        People more satisfied with their relationships in the 50s, where healthier in the 90s.
        People in bad relationships reported more pain in bad days.
        People who feel can count on their partners have sharper memory when they get older.
        People happiest in retirement, were the ones that worked had actively worked to replace workmates with friends.

    Alternate learning zone and performance zone
        **Learning zone** goal is to improve, concentrate on things we have not mastered, mistakes are expected. Maximizes growth. Good for long run.  Try out new strategies, ask questions,
        **Performance zone** do as best as we can, activities for execution, concentrate on activities we have mastered.

    Pillars of meaning
        **Seeking happiness causes unhappiness** Having the perfect job, boyfriend and apartment won't bring happiness
        **Belonging** being in relationships were you are valued for what you are or believe.
        **Find purpose** Use your strength to help others (maybe through work). You need something worthwhile to do, you need something to drive you forward,
        **Transcendence** experiences that make you loose sense of time (maybe programming)
        **Story telling** Creating a narrative of events of your life helps you to find purpose growth and purpose

    Things to avoid:
        Do not say 'like'
        Do not apologize for everything
        Do not eat too quick
        Do not focus conversations on you
        Do not talk too loud
        Do not interrupt people
        No nail biting

    What is you grandmother's name? You probably don't even know. In two generations no one will remember anything about you. Your actions do not matter in grand scheme of things. Stop worrying about what people will think or what is social acceptable, do what you want to do before it's too late.

Productivity & Life Strategies
    **Sleep at the same time every night** This habit enable you to fall asleep faster and wake up at the same time like clockwork, all subconsciously.

    **Do the most difficult thing first** Either the start of your day, the beginning of a project. After completing this task, you'll have not only done something meaningful with your day but you'll feel the momentum carry through to other tasks.

    **Replace common and recurring decisions with routines** You really don't need to expend mental energy picking an outfit, deciding on breakfast, thinking about when you should go to the gym. All of this keeps happening and the faster you commit to pre-selecting a single/few time slots or options, and sticking to them, the more mentally clear and swift you'll become with making decisions.

    **Avoid starting and stopping to eliminate your administrative overhead** When you stop a task to answer an email, help someone with something, or check notifications, you disrupt or completely avoid getting into deep work. Instead, designated a time to deal with all the ‘admin' stuff on your time, not someone else's.

    **Write down mistakes and lessons learned** We almost always repeat our mistakes, it's too hard to remember the lessons we thought we learned. Writing them down and revisiting them helps us etch them into our memory.

    **Design your environment to serve you** Whether this is cleaning your office, eliminating distractions, getting rid of bad influences, or surrounding yourself with like minded people. Designing your environment to push yourself in the direction you desire will have a disproportionately positive effect on your success, because of how easy it is to implement.

    **Identify and mentally label the credible people around you** It's hard to decipher constructive criticism from noise, if you have this list and keep it up to date, you'll have a much easier time in trusting opinions and getting honest feedback.

    **If it takes less than a few minutes to do, just do it** We procrastinate on many small things, that when they pile up, it becomes an actual problem. This rule doesn't mean disrupting deep work; that's a form of procrastination in itself. It means that when you aren't, you can bundle a few tasks together and be done with it in less than 10–15 minutes. Dishes out of the dishwasher, bed made, floor swept, call returned. It's easy and will leave a clean mental state for future you.

    **Have an overarching goal for the day** Each night, write one down for the next day. If you complete this, it was a successful day.

    **Bundle your social media distractions** Similar to designating hours for tasks like emails. If you designate a time in the day to consume Instagram, Facebook and Twitter, you'll be less distracted by every notification that comes in. An experiment I conducted earlier last year was to delete every social media app from my phone that had a desktop alternative, this worked quite nicely albeit less convenient. I now use well-being features available in the latest iOS and Android updates.

    **Make your communications clear and concise**Especially being true for emails. Dot points are a life saver and allow people to quickly decipher what's being said or requested. Beating around the bush or being overtly kind never helps. Conveying urgency, being firm and clear will get things done faster than going back and forth until the email chain is 30 emails long.

    **Dopamine**: Is the chemical of 'I want more of' I.E when eating chocolate you think about eating more and more not the pleasure of eating it.
    **Serotonin**: Is the chemical of 'enjoy doing' I.E spending time with your family.


Others
    **Lemons market** The buyers know more about the product than the buyer (like used cars), the cheaper product wins.
    When you buy something you are giving up something else (I.E earlier retirement). The happiness of buying something is usually less than not doing it and.
    **Social approval indicator** Let you think that people is taking about you without actually doing it.
    **Bad is stronger than good** we get more pain from losing 1k than good for winning 1k. Called negativity bias
    Bad emotions are contagious; do not escalate discussions


    **Decision making**: Don't do **binary decisions** but explore all the possibilitiesTry to predict what will happen if you do that; tell stories about what could happen, how thing would be better; worse and weird.
    If it doesn't matter in 5 years, it does not matter now.
    Lean to be okay with people not knowing your side of the story. You have nothing to prove to anyone.
    When you realize how unimportant you are to 99.99999% of the people, their judgment losses weight. They aren't worried about you, they have their own shit.
    Let me fall if I must fall. The one I will become will catch me.
    Everything you want is on the other side of fear
    I used to talk in a room and wonder if the liked me. Now I look around and wonder if I like them.
    **Conscientious people are the ones that age better**: They will go to the doctor when they are asked, They will take their medication, They will build a pension plan, etc...
    There is no such thing as **social classes**: only people financially
    free and not.
    You **enjoy trips
    three times**: planning it, doing it, and remembering it. There is no
    depreciation, good memories revalue.
    Don't give up your preferences
    to meet other people expectations. It's not a good strategy.

Awaken the Giant within
    The hardest step in achieving anything is **making a true commitment**.
    The most **successful people make decisions quickly** because they are clear on their values and what they want.
    The **more decisions you make** the better you're going to become at making them.
    Learn from your decisions. **Failure is necessary** and we can learn from it.
    **Make More decisions to learn and make better ones** in the future. Decision making gets better the more you do it.
    Stay committed to your ideas but with a flexible approach.
    Enjoy making decisions, decisions you make might change the course of your life forever.
    Everything people do is to avoid pain or to get pleasure.
    Do not try to change your behavior, understand it to take better decisions.
    Sometimes you know you should do something but you don't because it will bring temporary pain until not taking action is more painful than taking it. This is the **emotional threshold**.
    A man who suffers before it's necessary suffers more than it's necessary.
    The **secret of success is learning how to use pain and pleasure instead of having pain and pleasure use you**. If you do that, you're in control of your life. If you don't, life controls you.
    We are driven to avoid pain and to get pleasure, find out what motivates you, what brings you joy and focus your objectives on that. For instance, drug addicts link pleasure to drugs, Donald Trump to be more powerful, and Mother Teresa to help others. They are driven by this. Think what is pain and please experiences that shaped your life.
    We make neuro-associations of pain and pleasure. For instance, seeing a drunk family member when you are young will make you not want to try alcohol. You can use these experiences to shape and teach your children.
    We are not driven much by what we intellectually know but by what we learned to link pain and pleasure to.
    Put aside passing moments of terror and temptation, and focus on what's most important in he long term, your values and personal standards
    Look for a mentor in each aspect of life: relationships, finances, health etc someone with more experience.
    There are three things we can control in our life: what we focus on, what things mean and what to do in spite of our challenges.


The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck
    Our culture is obsessively focused on **unrealistically positive expectations**: be richer, happier, healthier, smarter, perfect job, more popular, more admired...
    All self-help guidance is fixation on what you lack.
    **The smallest dog barks the loudest**: A confident man does not need to prove that he's confident. A rich woman does not need to convince anyone that she is rich. If you dream about something all the time you reinforce the same unconscious reality: you are not that.
    The world is constantly telling us to buy more, be more, make more, own more, etc
    The key to a good life is not giving a fuck about more, it's giving a fuck about less, only about what is try and immediate and important.
    Everyone has flat TV, expensive phone, even groceries delivered. **Our crisis is no longer material but existential**. there are infinite amount of things we can now see and any number of ways we can discover that we don't measure up.
    The desire for a more positive experience is itself a negative experience.
    The acceptance of one's negative experience is itself a positive experience
    The richer you want to be the poorer you become, the sexier you want to be the uglier you feel.
    The less you care about something the better you will become at it.
    Not giving a fuck is to stare at life's terrifying challenges and take action.
    The moments of non-fucker are the moments that most define our lives: switch in careers, dropping out of college, join a rock band, dump your girlfriend... **Not giving a fuck is to stare life's most terrifying challenges and take action**.
    You have to learn to pick what matters to you based on your values and focus on that.
    You must give a fuck about something, it's in our biology.
    If you find yourself consistently giving too many fucks about trivial shit such as mouse batteries dying too quickly, your ex profile picture, etc.. It's because you don't have much going on in your life to give a legitimate fuck about and that is your real problem. If you have no problems, the mind finds a way to invent some.
    Maturity is learning to give a fuck about what's truly fuckworthy.
    Accept life, care about family, friends and personal goals.
    Problems never stop, they just get upgraded/changed: Happiness comes from solving problems. If you avoid them, then you're going to make yourself miserable. If you feel you can't solve your problems you will feel miserable. The secret is to learn how to solve the problems.
    Nobody actually happy has to stand in front of a mirror and tell himself that he's happy. Do not deny your problems or concerns. Exercises that make you feel good short term are useless and generate addiction.
    What pain do you want to sustain? A path to happiness is a path of shitheaps and shame.
    Who you are is defined by what you're willing to struggle for. If you enjoy the struggles of a gym, you can run triathlons. You can't win if you don't play.
    A true measure of self-worth is not how a person feels about her positive experiences, but about negative ones. A person with high self-worth can look at himself and say: Yes, sometimes I am irresponsible with money, and I should improve it. Entitled people are incapable of acknowledging their problems and are left chasing high after high accumulating deny, until reality hits.
    Because of the Internet, TV and social media, we think that **exceptionalism is the new normal**. Because of the people is average, we feel insecure and not good enough. We cope with this either with self-aggrandizing or other-aggrandizing (get rich quick scheme, saving starving babies in Africa, getting good marks, having sex with everyone...).
    Technology and mass marketing is screwing up people's expectations of themselves, there is a culture of exceptionalism.
    Your actions don't matter that much in the grand scheme of things, your life will be not noteworthy and that is ok.
    You should find appreciation for ordinary things: simple friendship, creating something, helping a person in need, reading a book, laughing with someone you care...
    Suffering is inevitable, problems of life are unavoidable, but you can choose what to suffer about. There was a Japanese soldier that was told to defend a jungle, he did not know the war had finished and continued killing civilians for 20 years after the war. He was told after that and came back to Japan. He was eating worms in the jungle for 20 years but happy to fight for a greater cause. When he came back society was just nerds and he got depressed. Another guy went to look for the Yeti and died but was happy to do something meaningful.
    The onion of self-awareness
        First layer: Understanding one's emotions. This is when I feel happy, this makes me feel sad, this gives me hope. Expressing emotions and understand them is difficult.
        Second layer: Ask why we feel certain emotions. Why do I feel angry? Is it because I failed to achieve a goal? Why people feel uninspired? They illuminate what we consider success or failure.
        Third level: Personal values, Why do I consider this to be a success/failure? How I am choosing to measure myself? What standard I am measuring myself and people around me? (very difficult to do). These values determine the nature of our problems and the quality of our life. Why do you feel the need to be rich in the first place? If people are unhappy is because of a particular value and not the fact they don't drive a Bentley.
    Honest self-questioning is difficult. It requires asking yourself simple questions that are uncomfortable to answer. Think about what is bugging you, then why. Chances are it is a failure of some sort. Then take that failure and ask why it seems true to you. Has it been a failure? Maybe you are looking at it the wrong way: Maybe I don't need to be close to my brother to have a good relationship that I value. Maybe just mutual respect and mutual trust. Maybe these metrics are better than how many text messages do we exchange. Not having a close relationship is fine. We get to control what our problems mean based on how we choose to think about them and measure them.
    Comparing ourselves with others rather than without standards it's a mistake and will make us unhappy (I.E Dave Mustaine vs Metallica and the Beattle that got kicked and happy with his family).
    If you want to change how you see your problems, you have to change what you value and how you measure success and failure.
    Shitty values
        **Pleasure**: Pleasure is a horrible value to prioritize. People who focus their energy on superficial pleasures end up more anxious, more emotionally unstable and depressed.
        **Material success**: Some people measure their success on how much money they make, what car they drive or if the front lawn is greener and prettier than next door. Once basic physical needs are provided, the correlation between happiness and worldly success approaches to zero. Prioritizing material success over other values, such as honesty, nonviolence, compassion is a mistake.
        **Always being right**: Our brains are inefficient machines. We constantly make poor assumptions, misjudge, misremember facts, make decisions based on emotional whims. We are wrong pretty much constantly. If your metric for success is being right, it will prevent you from learning from your mistakes, empathize with others. It is more helpful to assume that you're ignorant and don't know a lot. This keeps you unattached to superstitious or poorly informed beliefs and promotes constant state of learning and growth.
        **Staying positive** There are people who measure their lives by the ability to be positive about everything (lost job, parent dead, husband cheated, etc...) Sometimes life sucks and it's ok to admit it. Constant positivity is a form of avoidance, not a solution of life's problems. Things go wrong, people upset us and accidents happen. This makes us feel bad and it's ok. Negative emotions are a necessary component of emotional health, deny negativity is to perpetuate problems rather than solving them. We need to express problems in a socially acceptable manner and in a way that aligns with our values.
    Completing a marathon, raising a child or starting a business with our friends is going to give us lot's of problems to solve, but much more meaning and happiness in the long term than buying a new PC, finishing a video game, eating chocolate, etc...
    "One day, in retrospect, th years of struggle will strike you as the most beautiful" by Freud.
    Pleasure, material success, always being right and positiveness are poor ideas for a person's life. Some of the best moments of one's life are not pleasant, not material, not successful, not known and not positive.
    The points to nail down some good values and metrics. Pleasure and success will naturally emerge as a result.

    **Defining good values**
        Good values are reality based, socially constructive, immediate and controllable.
        Bad values are superstitious, socially destructive and not immediate or controllable.
        For example: Honest is a good value (it's something you have complete control over, it reflects reality and benefits others even if it is unpleasant). Popularity is a bad value. If being the most popular in the dance is important, much of what happens will be out of control (you don't know who else is in the party, or who they are. The metric is not real, you feel popular/unpopular but you don't know what other people think.
        Examples of healthy values: honesty, innovation, vulnerability, standing up for oneself or others, self-respect, curiosity, charity, humility, creativity. These values can be achieved internally. Bad values rely on external events.
        Everyone wants a private jet, the question is your priorities and what influences your decisions making. I.E Hiroo Onoda's loyalty to Japanese empire.
        This is **what self improvement is about**, prioritizing better values choosing better things to give a fuck about. Better problems mean better life.

    We are always taking an active role in what's occurring to and within us, interpreting the meaning of every moment and occurrence. We are always choosing what values we live and metrics by which we measure everything that happens to us.
    **Accepting responsibility for our problems is the first step to solve them**. I.E. A man is too short. Even though he is intelligent, interesting and good looking. Because he thinks he is too short, we does not go out and does not try to meet women. This is a crappy value: Not being tall enough. A better value would have been I want to date women who like me for who I am.

    We are responsible for experiences that aren't our fault all the time, this is part of life. We need to take responsibility of our own emotions. Blaming other for how you feel will only hurt yourself.
    **Victimhood Chic**: The responsibility/fault fallacy allow people to pass off the responsibility for solving their problems to others. This gives a temporary high blaming other people and a feeling of moral righteousness.
    **Outrage porn**: Rather than reporting real stories of real problems, the media finds a problem mildly offensive, broadcasts it to some audience, generate outrage, then broadcast that outrage back to the population to outrage another part of the population. This triggers an echo of bullshit pinging back and forth between two imaginary sides, distracting everyone from real problems.

    People gets addicted to feeling offended all the time because it gives them a high, self-righteous and morally superior feeling.

    Our values are imperfect and incomplete. This openness to being wrong must exist for real change or growth to take place.



Sharpen the saw
    Working smarter, not harder: Besides allowing you to get more done, regularly making time to take care of yourself also increases your sense of agency and effectiveness.
    When it comes to our personal lives, we should focus on four domains: physical, spiritual, mental, and social/emotional.
    All of these dimensions are interconnected. If we feel good physically, we have mental clarity and better control of our emotions. If our social life is good, we'll have more motivation and energy to take care of ourselves physically. And because these human domains are interconnected, it allows us to synergize them which will enable you to do more in less time (more on that below).


The Compound Effect
    **Routines** are important. Soldiers are trained with routines, so even with the imminent threat of death, they can carry out their duties with precision in the middle of the chaos of combat.

    Get used to **journaling**, summarize what you achieved at the end of the day, what went well and not so well, any ideas you had or thoughts, what is worth doing tomorrow.

    Doing the same things week after week will stop showing compounded results (i.e. change workout) mix it up, challenge yourself in new ways.

    Consider adding more adventure to your life: eating different kinds of food, taking a class, visiting a new place, meet new people helps you feel alive.

    You should design your morning and evening routines in a journal.

    Pick 3 things you are not satisfied with your life and you want to improve, write 20 actions you could do to improve them.

    You are 100% responsible for your life and your choices.

    Your brain is not designed to make you happy. Your brain has only one agenda in mind: survival. It is designed to seek out negative resources. Avoid watching the news. You should protect what you feed to your mind.

    Commercials are designed to make you feel bad about yourself unless you buy things you don't need.

    **News and magazines have no bearing in your personal life and goals**, dreams or ambitions. Use RSS or twitter to filter what you care.

    People who you usually associate are called reference group. A lot of your success is determined by them. We become the combined average of the five people we hang around the most. The people whom we spend our time determine what conversations dominate our attention and opinions we are exposed, our ambitions, our habits, etc...

    To improve in an area, you can find an accountability partner who tries to achieve the same goals, to share the pain and motivate each other. Or find a mentor and have a weekly call of 30 mins.

The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People
    **Overview**. We have two mental maps, the map that shows how we see things and the one that shows how things should be. When we describe what we see, we in effect describe how we see ourselves, our perceptions and our paradigms. When someone disagrees with us, we think something is wrong with them. Each looks through the unique lens of experience.
    Principles are guidelines for human conduct, values are maps that people decide to use for guidance.
    Admission of ignorance is the first step in our education.
    **Habit** is the intersection of knowledge, skill, and desire. This is what to do, how to do it and wanting to do it. You need the three.
    Happiness can be defined as the fruit of the desire and ability to sacrifice what we want now for what we want eventually.
    The following habits are aimed at improving efficiency to maximize long term benefit and growth.
    **p** is production and **p/c** production capability. You need to find and keep an **optimal P/PC balance** for efficiency growth.
    Our most important financial asset is our own capacity to earn. Invest in improving your p/c.
    P/PC can be seen in software development as technical debt.
    **Habit 1: Be proactive**. Self-awareness is the ability to think about your thought process. It enables us to examine the way we see ourselves and others.
    A lot of what we are is determined by three factors: **genetic determinism** determined in our DNA, **psychic determinism** or childhood friends and parents, and **environmental determinism** which is your spouse, boss, and economic situation.
    Proactively is taking initiative, being responsible for our own lives, making things happen.
    Reactive people is affected by weather, they build their emotional lives around the behaviour of others, empowering the weaknesses of others to control them. They are driven by feelings, circumstances and affected by their environment.
    Proactive people are driven by values carefully thought about, selected and internalized. Proactive people is still influenced by external stimuli but their response is value-based.
    Gandhi: They can not take away our self respect if we don't give it to them.
    It is not what happens to us that hurts us, but our response.
    Proactive people focus their efforts in the **Circle of influence**. They work on the things they can do something about.
    Reactive people focus their efforts on their **Circe of concern**: on the weaknesses of other people, problems in the environment, and circumstances you cannot control, victimization, reactive language.
    Problems can be classified in three categories: **Direct control** problems: they involve our own behaviour and we can solve them by working on our habits. **Indirect control** problems: involve other people's behaviour and you can fix by changing our methods of influence, and **No control** problems which we can not do anything about, like past situations, which we have to smile and learn to live with them.
    The **have's** and **be's**: The circle of concern is filled with the have's (I'll be happy when I have my house paid off, if I had a more patient husband, if I had more free time...). The circle of influence is filled with be's: I can be more patient, wiser, be more loving.
    Every time we think the problem is out there, that thought is the problem. We empower what's out there to control us.
    We are totally free to choose our actions, but not the consequences of those. The proactive approach is to immediately acknowledge **mistakes**, learn from those and correct it in the future. Reactive people will justify it, deceive it and rationalize it to self and others, giving it disproportionate importance, causing deeper injury to self and others.
    The response to any mistake affects the quality of the next movement. It is important to admit it and correct it quickly so it does not have power on the next movement and we are empowered again.
    The **commitments** we make and the integrity to those is the essence and clearest manifestation of our proactivity.
    The power to make and keep commitments to ourselves is the essence of developing the basic habits of effectiveness.
    We are responsible for our own effectiveness, happiness, and most of our circumstances.

    **Habit 2: Begin with the end in mind**
    If this were your funeral and your relatives and friends where making a speech, what'd you like them to say? what type of person would you like their words to reflect? what character would you like them to have seen in you? what achievements? what to remember?
    If the ladder is not leaning against the right wall, very step we take gets us to the wrong place faster.
    **Personal mission statement** or philosophy or creed. It focuses on what you want to be (character) and to do (achievements) and values or principles  in which those are based. Example
    Succeed at home first. Never compromise with honesty. Hear both sides before judging. Defend those who are absent. Be sincere and decisive. Develop a new proficiency every year. Plan tomorrow's work today. Keep sense of humor. Be orderly in person and at work. Do not fear mistakes. Maintain positive attitude. I will try to keep myself free from addictive and destructive habits. Money will be my servant not my master. Seek FI. Use money to make life more enjoyable.
    People have **centers** in which people focuses: **Spouse**, **Family**: growth from family traditions. **Money**: economic security. **Work**: workaholics sacrifice other things in life. **Possession**: physical but also intangible like fame glory. **Pleasure**: we live in a world where instant gratification is available and encouraged. **Friend enemy**: belonging to a peer group. **Church**. **Self centeredness**.

    **Habit 3: But first things first**
    Effective time management if putting first things first. Leadership decides what first things are, management puts them first.
    **Time management matrix**: an activity can be defined in terms of **urgent** and **important**.
    Urgent things act on us (a phone ringing), they press on us, insist on action, easy to do. Often they are also unimportant.
    Important things will involve results and are related to your mission, values and high priority goals.
    We **react** to urgent matters. Important matters require initiative and proactivity.
    **Quadrant 1** are tasks urgent and important (putting out fires). They drive our lives. We want to reduce those. They lead to stress, burnout. It is important to correctly categorize the tasks from Q1 and Q3 (not important).
    **Quadrant 2** is the heart of effective time management. It deals with things that are not urgent but important. I.E building relationships, writing a personal mission statement, exercising, preventive maintenance. What things could you do regularly that would have a tremendous positive difference in your life? Also, spending time on preventing activities in Q2 will also reduce tasks of Q1.
    You need to plan the activities of Q2 according to your values and mission statement. This will cause natural inclination towards doing those and not spending time on Q3 and Q4.
    Activities in Q2 increase your production and production capability.
    Your planning methodology should take into account: **Coherence** with your mission statement, roles, goals, desires and discipline. **Balance**: in your life, to not neglect important areas or roles. Think about two goals you want to achieve for each role. **Q2 focus**: Your methodology should move you into Q2. **Flexibility**: your planning tool should adapt to you. If should be **portable**
    Organize on weekly basis.
    Do not prioritize what's in your schedule but schedule your priorities.
    Emotional Bank account is a metaphor that describes the amount of trust that's been built up in a relationship.
    Seeking to understand another person is one of the most important deposits you can make.
    Making something important for another person important to you is a good deposit.
    Small discourtesies, little unkindness and disrespect makes large withdrawals. Little things mean big things.
    The cause of almost all relationship difficulties is rooted in conflicting or ambiguous expectations around roles and goals.
    One of the most important ways to manifest integrity is to **be loyal to those who are not present**. In doing so, we build the trust of those who are present. When you defend those who are absent, you retain the trust of those present.
    **I really shouldn't be saying this** makes a massive withdrawn to the person present as shows you can not be trusted.
    **Integrity** you should treat everyone with the same set of principles.

    **Habit 4: Think win/win**: Win/Win is a frame of mind and heart that constantly seeks mutual benefit in all human interactions. Agreements/solutions are mutually beneficial and satisfying. All parties feel committed to the action plan and good about the decision. Win/Win sees like as a cooperative not competitive arena.
    **Win/Lose mentality** is used when one child is compared to another. It lies on competition not cooperation. Like school, law.
    **Lose/win** is a paradigm with no expectations, standards, demands or vision. Little courage to express their own feelings and are intimidated by ego strength of others. They bury feelings and have disproportionate range or anger, overreaction to provocations. This affects relationships with others.
    **Win/win or no deal** if no solution for both is reached, we walk away.
    Win/Win performance agreements can have four types of rewards managers or parents can provide: psychic (recognition...) financial. opportunity (training), responsibility.
    **Habit 5: Take time to understand** first, is important in empathic communication. Take time to understand the other before trying to get them to understand you.
    There are **four types of listening**: Ignoring: not listening at all. Pretending: "yeah, huh-huh, right". Selective listening: hear only parts of the conversation. Attentive listening: Paying attention and focusing our energy on the words being said. **Empathic listening**: listening with intent to understand. The essence is not to agree with someone; but to understand emotionally and intellectually the other person. 60% is body language. Do not listen with your autobiography and assuming your thoughts. Diagnose before you prescribe.
    If someone replies with logical answers you can keep pushing, if they become emotional back off and try to understand.
    The vision of the world is very limited by our experiences. We suffer from shortage of data. Appreciate interacting with other points of view. These differences add to your knowledge. Value the difference in other people, do not take insults personally.

    **Habit 7: Sharpen the saw**: is personal PC. it's renewing and exercising regularly the four dimensions of your nature: physical, spiritual, mental and social/emotional.
    Sharpening the saw is a Q2 activity. We have to make it a healthy addiction.
    **Physical dimension** involves eating well, getting the right sleep&relaxation, and exercising regularly. Exercising is a Q2 activity, and not doing it lets to Q1 health problems.
    **Mental dimension**: Some people stop studying when they finish school and spend their time watching TV. Practice habit 3 and spend less time on things that do not produce P or PC.
    Writing is a powerful way to sharpen the saw. Keep journal of thoughts, experiences, insights, leanings promotes mental clarity, exactness and context.
    Organizing and planning represents other forms of mental renewal associated with Habits 2 and 3.
    **Social/Emotional dimension**: Integrity is the most fundamental source of personal worth. Long healthy life is the result of making contributions, having meaningful projects that are personally exciting and contributing to bless the lives of others.
    Treat a man as he is and he will remain as he is, treat a man as he can be and he will become what he can be.
    The more proactive you are (habit 1), the more effectively you can exercise personal leadership (habit 2) and management (habit 3), the more Q2 activities you do (habit 7) the more you seek first to understand (habit 5), the more effectively you can find synergetic win/win solutions (habit 4 and 6).
    True financial independence relies on  continuing your education, your power to produce, to learn, create, adapt, wealth is intrinsic.
    Spending one hour a day to renew your physical and spiritual and mental dimensions is the key to the development of the 7 habits.
    Choose purpose and principles to live by; otherwise the vacuum will be filled and we will lose our self-awareness. Learn, commit, do, repeat.
    Struggle is worthwhile and fulfilling. It gives meaning to life and enabled to love, serve and try again.

Rich Dad, Poor Dad
    **Rat race**: Working for your salary, increasing your expenses/taxes when your salary goes up and being stuck in this cycle.
    Education is the foundation of success.
    The reason the rich get richer, the poor poorer and the middle class struggles is because the subject of money is taught at home, not in school.
    Saying 'I can't afford it' makes your brain stop thinking. Saying 'how can I afford it' makes you think.
    Your house is a liability not an investment.
    Don't work for money, make your money work for you.
    **Lesson 1: The rich don't work for money**. If you learn life's lessons, you will do well. If not, life will continue to push around. Don't push back against people, it's life that is pushing. Life pushes all of us around. Some gives up, some fight. Don't blame others for your problems.
    Don't be the nice hard-working guy; don't spend life playing it safe and doing the right things.
    You have to realize that you are the problem. It's easier to change yourself than everyone else.
    The poor and the middle class work for money. The rich have money work for them.
    Don't get in big debt and settle for 3 week vacation and a pension after 45 years of work.
    **The rat race** is increasing your expenses every time your salary goes up, needing more money.
    People who say they don't work for money are lying. No one wants to work 8 hours a day every day.
    Be truthful about your emotions and use your mind and emotions in your favor, not against yourself. Be an observer, not a reactor to your emotions. Don't let your emotions do the thinking and talk on your behalf.
    Unfortunately, for many people school is the end, not the beginning.
    Don't let money run your life, asking yourself if your paycheck will be enough.
    Learn to use your emotions to think, not think with your emotions..
    Instead of working for money, learn to have money work for you.
    Working harder is not usually the best solution to your financial problems.
    A job is a short term solution to a long term problem.
    People prepared to be flexible, keep an open mind and learn, they will grow richer and richer.
    It's not how much money you make, but how much money you keep.
    You must know the difference between an **asset** and a **liability**, and buy assets.
    An asset is something that pushes money into your pocket. A liability is something that takes money out of your pocket.
    The cause of financial struggle is people's spending habits, spending all they have and seeking a better paid job to spend more. They are in a hole and keep digging.
    The middle class considers their home their primary asset, instead of investing in income-producing assets.
    **Wealth** is a person's ability to survive so many days forward. Unlike **net worth**, which includes your liabilities as assets and is inaccurate. Wealth measures how much money your money is making and, therefore, your financial survivability.
    **Lesson 2 Why teach financial literacy?**
    **Lesson 3 Mind your own business**
    The mistake of becoming what you study is that people forget to own their own business. They spend their lives minding someone else's business and making them rich. Focus on your assets column and growing those, instead of your income statement.
    You can keep your day job but focusing your paycheck to acquire assets like: owning business that do not require my presence (stock, bonds, mutual funds, real estate, notes).
    Buy luxuries last, first get rich increasing your asset column.
    **Lesson 4: The history of taxes and the power of corporation**
    It's been shown in history that the rich always outsmarted the intellectuals and manage to evade taxes. The rich has money power and intent to change things.
    The tax man will always take more if you let him.
    If you work for money, you give the power to your employer, if money works for you, you keep control of the power.
    **Lesson 5: The rich invent money**
    **Lesson 6: Work to learn, don't work for money**
    Great talent in a specific field is not enough to become rich.
    **Financial intelligence** is the synergy of accounting, investing, marketing and law. These are the skills that will help you make money, not working hard. For example, a programmer learning marketing and sales but get his income increased dramatically.
    **You want to learn a little about a lot**. I was a shy person so I became a salesman at Xerox.
    Job is an acronym for just over broke. Workers work hard enough to not be fired, and owners pay just enough so workers won't quit.
    Every year you get a pay raise and every year you will be disappointed.
    Life is much like going to the gym, the hardest part is deciding to go. Once workout is over, you are always glad you went.
    Maybe McDonal's does not make the best burger, but they are the best at delivering an average burger.
    The main management skills needed for success are: management of cash flow, management if systems, management of people, sales and marketing.
    Communication skills such as writing, speaking and negotiating are crucial to life success.
    Selling and marketing are difficult for most people primarily due to their fear or rejection.
    Spend a year learning to sell, your communications skills will improve.
    **Overcoming obstacles**
    The main reason financially literate people does not develop assets are: fear, chrism, laziness, bad habits, arrogance.
    **The compound interest** is one of the wonders of the world.
    For most people, the pain of losing money is far greater tha the joy of being rich.
    Failure inspires winners, and failure defeats losers.
    People go broke over a duplex, they buy big houses and big cars, but not big investments. They play life too safe and too small.
    Overcoming **cynicism**: It takes courage to not let rumors and talk of doom and gloom affect your doubts and fears. We are all little chickens running in circles. Don't let doubts and dears close your mind, open your eyes.
    In the end, the only real asset you have is your mind.
    Choose friends that bring something to your life and that you can learn from.
    People say "you are what you eat" I say: "You become what you study". Be careful with what you learn.
    In today's fast-changing world, it's not so much what you know anymore that counts, but **how fast you learn**. That skill is priceless. Working hard for money is an old formula.
    The number one delineating factor between the rich, the poor and the middle class is the **self-discipline**.
    Don't get in large debt positions, keep your expenses low, build your assets first.
    Savings are used to create more money first, not to pay bills. Every day, with every dollar you decide to be rich or poor.


Atomic Habits
    A habit is a routine or behaviour performed regularly, and in many cases, automatically.
    If you can get 1% better each day, you will 37% better in a year.
    Habits are the **compound interest** of self-improvement.
    The impact created by a change in your habits is similar to the effect of **shifting the route** of an airplane a few degrees.
    Making a choice that makes you **1% better or worse seem insignificant**, but over your lifetime these choices determine the difference between who you are and who you could be. Success is the product of daily habits.
    You should be more concerned about your current trajectory than your results.
    Your outcomes are a **lagging measure of your habits**: Net worth is the measure of your financial habits, weight of eating habits, clutter of cleaning habits, etc... **You get what you repeat**.
    Check out how your daily choices will compound ten or fifteen years down the line.
    **Tiny battles** like reading books, going to the gym will define your future self. You need to know how habits work, and design them to your liking to avoid the dangerous half of the blade.
    **Knowledge compounds**: Learning a new idea won't make you a genius, but commitment to lifelong learning can be transformative.
    Habits appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold and unlock a new level of performance.
    **All big things come from small beginnings** Atomic habit refers to a tiny change, a marginal gain, a 1% improvement.
    There are **three layers of behavioral change**: Changing your outcomes (losing weight), changing your process (new gym routine) and changing your identify (self image, judgments about yourself and others, worldview).
    You might start a habit because of motivation, but you need to change your identity to stick to it. Research shows if you believe in an aspect of your identity, you are more likely to act in alignment with that belief. I.E Voters vote more than people who vote.
    You need to find out what are your principles and values, who do you want to become. Are you becoming the person you want to become? The first step is not the how, but the who.
    Habits reduce cognitive load and free up mental capacity.
    Building an habit can be divided in four steps: **cue, craving, response and reward.
    Every craving is linked to a desire to change your internal state.
    **Cue** is about noticing the reward.
    **Craving** is about wanting the reward.
    **Response** is obtaining the reward.
    For example: Clue: your phone buzzes, craving: you want to learn the contents of the message, response: you grab the phone and read it, reward: you satisfy your craving to read the message. Grabbing the phone becomes associated with your phone buzzing.
    The **four laws of behavior change**: Make it obvious (cue), make it attractive (craving), make it satisfying (reward).
    You can invert these laws to learn how to **break a bad habit**: Make it invisible (cue), make it unattractive (carving), make it difficult (response), make it unsatisfying (reward).
    This is a continuous process, there is no finish line. Keep rotating through the four laws to fix the next bottleneck.
    **Habit scorecard**: Make a list of your daily habits: wake up, turn off alarm, check my phone, go to the bathroom. Score each one good+, bad- or =.
    There are no good or bad habits, only effective habits. Effective at solving problems.
    People who make a specific plan for when and where they will perform a new habit are more likely to follow through. I.E I will exercise for one hour at 5pm in my local gym.
    A fresh start is motivating.
    **Diderot effect** states that obtaining a new possession often creates a spiral of consumption that leads to additional purchases.
    **Habit stacking** is a special form of an implementation intention. Rather than pairing your new habit with a time and location you pair it with a current habit. I.E after I pour my cup of coffee in the morning, I will meditate for one minute. Set of simple rules to guide your future behavior.
    Change in **what you see** can lead to a big shift in **what you do**. Its important to live and work in environments filled with productive cues and avoid unproductive ones.
    Every habit is initiated by a cue, and we are more likely to notice cues that stand out. I.E It's easy not to take your vitamins if they are stored away.
    If you want to make a habit a big part of your life, make the cue a big part of your environment. I.E have the house plenty of bottles of water.
    People with best self-control are those who need it less. They spend less time in tempting situations.
    **Make it invisible**: One if the best ways to eliminate a bad habit is to reduce exposure to the cue that causes it.
    After spending hundreds of thousands of years hunting and foraging for food in the wild, the human brain has evolved to place **high value on salt, sugar and fat**.
    Humans want to fit in, to bond with others, and to earn the respect and approval of our peers.
    **One of the deepest human desires is to belong**. Charles Darwin: In the long history of humankind, those who learned to collaborate and improvise most effectively have prevailed.
    Behaviors are attractive when they help us fit in.
    We pick up habits from the people around us. We copy the way parents handle arguments, the way our peers flirt with one another, coworkers get results, when your wife has the habit of checking that the door is closed twice, you do too, etc...
    Family and friends provide an invisible peer pressure that pulls us to in their direction.
    We soak up the qualities and practices of those around us.
    When you join a book club or a band or a cycling group, your identify becomes linked to those around you.
    Reframe your habits to highlight the benefits rather than their drawbacks. Your brain will think they are more attractive. I.E a wheelchair liberates you. I.E rather than I need to go running in the morning, think It;'s time to build endurance and get fast. Reframe I am nervous with I am excited and Im getting an adrenaline rush to help me concentrate.
    **It doesn't feel good to fail** or be judged publicly, so we tend to avoid situations where this might happen. This is why you avoid and delay action.
    The brain is like the muscles of the body, they adapt as they are used and atrophy as they are abandoned.
    **Organize each space for its intended purpose**, making the next action easy. Want to work out? Have your gym clothes and bag ready.
    Create an environment where doing the right think is as easy as possible.
    The greater the friction, the less likely the habit.
    Do not overwork, you need to make your habits fun. The secret is to say below the point where it feels like work.
    What is rewarded is repeated, what is punished is avoided. **Make your habits satisfying**.
    Make the immediate outcome pleasant or you won't repeat.
    Good habits tend to not provide immediate pleasure and what ones do (watching tv against working out).
    Make a habit feel successful to stick to it.
    Habit tracking is powerful because it leverages multiple laws of behavioral change: make a behavior obvious, attractive, and satisfying. It also keeps you honest. It creates a visual cue that reminds you to act, in inherently motivating, and is satisfying when you record another successful instance of you habit. It's a visual proof that you are casting votes for the type of person you wish to become.
    Bad days hurt you more than good days. You need a 50% increase to get from 100 to 150. But only 33% loss to get back to 100. The 'bad' workouts are the most important ones. They let you keep your compound gains. It's not always the result of the workout, is about being the type of person who doesn't miss a workout.
    We teach for standardized test instead of emphasizing learning, curiosity and critical thinking. **We optimize for what we measure**. When the measure becomes the target, it ceases to be a good measure.
    The more immediate and costly a mistake is, the faster you learn from it. I.E bad reviews. If you want to prevent bad habits adding an instant cost to the action is a great way.
    Having an **accountability partner** is useful. Knowing that someone is watching can be a powerful motivator.
    Big five personality traits: curious and inventive vs cautious and consistent, organized and efficient vs easygoing and spontaneous, introvert vs extrovert, friendly vs challenging, anxious and sensitive vs confident and calm. You should build habits that work for your personality. Shape the exercise around your interest (I.E gym vs cycling). Work hard on the things that come easy.
    The human brain loves challenges, but only if it's within an optimal zone of difficulty. I.E playing tennis against someone who is much better than you is boring.
    The **Goldilock rule** states that humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities.
    Reflection and review enables the long term improvement of all habits because it makes you aware of your mistakes and helps you consider possible paths for improvement.
    Perform an **annual review** in which you reflect the previous year. How many articles published, new skills, workouts, new places visited, whatever is important for you. What went well? What didn't go so well? What did I learn?
    Perform an **integrity report**: Use it to determine what went wrong, revisit your core values, and consider if you have been living according to them. Reflect on your identity and how you can work toward being the person you want to become. What are your core values in work/life? How can you set higher standards?
    Your identity creates **a kind of pride** that encourages you to deny your weak points, and prevents you from growing.
    A **lack of self-awareness** is poison, and Reflection and review is the antidote.
    **Happiness is the absence of desire**. It is the state you enter when you no longer want to change your state or react to cues.
    **Being curious is better than being smart** Being motivated and curious counts more than being smart, because it leads to action.
    Being poor is not having too little, it is wanting more. If your wants outpace your likes, you will always be unsatisfied.

Your Money or Your Life
    **Financial intelligence** is being able to step back from your assumptions and emotions about money and observe them objectively.
    **Financial integrity** is knowing what is enough money and material goods to keep you at the peak of fulfillment, and what is just excess and clutter. It is having all aspects of your financial life in alignment with your values.
    Debt and lack of savings makes our nine to five routine mandatory.
    Lottery winners are less happy than they used to before.
    We build our working lives on the myth of more. More responsibilities, more perks, more possessions, more prestige, and more respect. But rather than satisfaction, the more we have, the more we want. More clothes, bigger house, new widget.
    The US converted in the 20s leisure from being a relaxed activity and transformed into an opportunity for increased consumption. We are not citizens we are consumers.
    People is driven by fear, promise of exclusivity, guilt, greed and need of approval. Advertisement aims at throwing us off balance emotionally.
    When we are depressed or lonely we buy to make us feel better. When we want to celebrate we buy, when we are bored we buy. We try to **satisfy essentially psychological and spiritual needs with consumption**.
    When we are kids, we are told the message that **money is happiness by giving us presents**. But as an adult, more **money means more responsibilities and more worry**: more expensive car, expensive home, getting robed, tax accountants, needing a better job...
    **The money fulfilment curve** shows that once the basic needs are covered, more money usually decreases happiness. **Declutering** helps reduce this.
    Sell the possessions you don't use.
    Money is something we choose to trade our life energy and time for.
    Ask yourself, is this expenditure of life energy i alignment with my values and life purpose?
    **You pay for money with your time**. You choose how you spend it.
    Men do not desire to be rich, only to be richer than other men.
    **Financial independence** is having enough. Avoiding the drama of nine to five till you're sixty five. Making a dying.
    Discern which expenses are fitting and fulfilling and which are unnecessary extravagant.
    You can never get enough of what you don't really want.
    Our values are those principles and qualities that matter to us. Living our values give us peace of mind. Values are the ideas and beliefs on which we base our decisions.
    You need to know your purpose of life.
    **Frugality** is getting good value for every minute of your life energy and from everything you have the use of. Waste lies not in the number of possessions but in the failure to enjoy them. Frugal means having a high joy-to-stuff ratio. Frugality is valuing your most precious resource: your energy.
    Often it's not material things we enjoy as much as what these things symbolize: conquest status, success, achievement...
    Riding a bicycle saves money three times: in gas, gym and doctor bills.
    Invest in preventive actions. I.E cleaning your teeth. Wore things out.
    Research your purchases, the cheapest is not always the best.
    Across time and culture the following needs are universal: subsistence, protection, affection, understanding, participation, recreation, identity and freedom.
    People don't need enormous cars, closets full of clothes. They need to feel attractive and excitement. People don't need electronic equipment, the need something worthwhile to do with their  . People need identify, community, challenge, acknowledgment, love and joy. Trying to fill these needs with material things will result in **psychological emptiness** and it's the main desire for material growth.
    **Be in active pursuit of health**. Cultivate new friends, specially younger ones and participate in a community. Simplify your possessions.
    Giving presents is an important way to express love.
    **Fulfillment** is knowing when you have enough. You should ask yourself: Am I likely to get fulfillment from this money spent in proportion to the resources that it represents? Is this purchase in alignment with my values?
    Men used to hunt and women to gather for two and a half days a week. That averages a 15h a week or 3h per day. The notion that everyone should have a job came with the industrial revolution.
    **Leisure** is a commodity to be purchased, rather than free time to be enjoyed. Consumption keeps the wheels of progress moving.
    The value of leisure has dropped and the value of work risen.
    **What do you want to be when you grow up**? is part of the problem. You should instead ask what do you want to do.
    Why do we give the best years of our lives to our jobs?
    Work has two functions: financial and personal (emotional, intellectual, psychological).
    The problem with our paid employment is that our needs for stimulation, recognition, growth, contribution, interaction and meaning are not meet by our jobs.
    We have **confused work with paid employment**. Work is any productive or purposeful activity. Paid employment is one activity among many other. It does not need to provide with our sense of meaning, purpose and fulfillment.
    Our fulfillment as humans beings lies not in our jobs but in the whole picture of our lives.
    Our real work is just to live our values as best we know how.
    We forgot important jobs like loving our mates, being a decent neighbor or developing a sustaining philosophy of life.
    Happiness is our birthright.
    The purpose of paid employment is getting paid and your real work is far bigger than this one job. By separating work and wages you can see more clearly whether you ar valuing your life energy.
    How much money do you need to be at the peak of fulfillment?
    Your job consist on working on someone else's agenda.
    Disconnect work from wages, say I work as a programmer, rather than saying I am a programmer.
    There is our work life, our home life, our community life, our inner life and our secret life.
    When you retire, the quality of your retirement will be enhanced if you have been able to disconnect your work from your wages. Retirement should be retirement from paid employment, not from life.
    You are not only working when earning money. Taking care of yourself, your home, your family is unpaid work.
    There is an almost universal belief in our culture that if you are unemployed your are nobody.
    For greeks, **leisure was the highest good**, the essence of freedom, a time for self-development, and for higher pursuits. Yet we are unable to relax and enjoy our leisure.
    The only purpose of paid employment is getting paid. Increase your income.
    **Savings** is money put aside for something. **Capital** is money that keeps working for you.
    Align your earning and spending with your values and with what brings you fulfillment.
    Reflect on your life while you are living it.
    Leave the nine to five straitjacket, stop climbing a career ladder, follow the promptings of your heart and mind.


Acierta al Comprar una Vivienda
    La piedra angular de la compra de una vivienda siempre será el precio. El precio no será lo que diga el vendedor, sinó lo que un comprador esté dispuesto a pagar.
    Para ver el precio de mercado de una vivienda, busca en Idealista y fíjate en viviendas de similares características en el mismo barrio.
    El **valor catastral** lo calcula cada municipio cada 10 años. Se divide en suelo y construcción.Solo el pripietario puede pedirlo en el ayuntamiento con el IBI. Según este valor pagarás más o menos IBI.
    El **valor fiscal** es la valoración que ha hecho el gobierno de tu comunidad autónoma y puede ser superior al valor de mercado. Dependiendo de este valor pagarás más o menos ITP. Si compras por debajo de este valor, pagarás más impuestos.
    Ambos valores vienen con el IBI. Puedes pedirle al propietario cuanto paga de IBI y calcular el valor fiscal en la web de Hacienda.
    Para la compra de una vivienda de segunda mano se paga el impuesto **ITP**, es 10% en Cataluña.
    Los gastos de compra suelen ser de 1.5% del valor de la propiedad.
    Las **hipotecas** se paga un interés medido con el Euribor, que es el índice de referencia del interés en que se prestan dinero los bancos. Las hipotecas suelen mencionar el **TIN** y el **TAE**. A ti te interesa en TAE que agrupa todos los costes de hacer la hipoteca y hace el promedio anual.
    En España se utiliza el sistema francés: todos los meses pagas lo mismo de hipoteca, pero los primeros años casi todo son intereses, y estos se van reduciendo a medida que amortizas.
    Hay hipotecas fijas, variables o mixtas. Normalmente las mixtas tienen lo malo de fijas y variables al principio pagas muchos intereses, y a lo largo tienes la incertidumbre del Euribor.
    Negocia con el banco poder amortizar más sin pagar comisión.
    El **seguro de vida** es para pagar la hipoteca si mueres. La mayoría de entidades lo exigen.
    El **seguro de hogar** es obligatorio por ley, puedes contrtarlo con la hipoteca o otra empresa.
    **Dación de pago** te permite saldar la hipoteca entregando la propiedad.
    Habla con los vecinos del inmueble que te interesa, para conocer si ha habido problemas, vecinos molestos, problemas con el ayuntamiento, obras pendientes, derramas (fachada, ascensor, filtraciones, rellano, ...)
    **Ubicación**:observa el estado de las calles, como son los vecinos, ruidos, aceso a carreteras, servicios básicos, grafitis, aceras manchadas, fachadas antiguas, farmacias, ambulatorios, supermercados, buses, metros.
    Las plantas bajas són las que más polvo acumulan.
    Los metros cuadrados suelen estar mal indicados, suelen ser los no útiles o directamente estan mal en el plano. Mira la escritura y catastro y pueden no coincidir. Pasillos son no útiles. Evita distribuciones raras.
    Lo que da un aspecto más antiguo es lo más caro de reformar: cocinas (vitro,encimera) o baños (inodoros, duchas). Fonaternia y cuadro elétricos son caros de cambiar.
    Visita el mismo inmueble por lo menos dos veces: en un día luminoso y en uno lluvioso. No visites más de 3 inmuebles en un mismo día.
    Las segundas viviendas se suelen vender porque el cash hace falta.
    Para comprar un piso, tendrás que hacer una **reserva** dejando una señal en la agencia. EL siguiente paso son las **arras**, 10-15 días desde la reseva. Se paga 5k-10k si el comprador se echa para atrás lo pierde. Si el vendedor se echa para atrás lo paga.  hay cláusulas resolutorias que te permite evitar perder el dinero, si no te conceden la hipoteca, etc.. Se fijan 60 días para ir al notario y firmar, tiempo para conseguir hipoteca.
    Cuando se transmite la vivienda, se hace libre de cargas. Para que no quede nada pendiente.


The Book on Rental Property Investing
    Rental properties are great because they let you **bug with leverage**, you buy with bank's money to increase the potential return and risk.
    Rental property investing lets you manager your own investment, you are directly responsible for the outcome. People always need a place to live, demand won't end. The equity is fairly stable and predictable.
    **Appreciation** is an increase in the value of an asset over time. It can be natural: tendency for prices to rise over time, or forced: doing an improvement to the place to increases it. Counting on appreciation to be profitable is especulating and not recommended.
    **Cash flow** is the amount of income left after paying all the bills. Usually expressed as monthly dollar amount. It is the most important wealth generator for rental property investors.
    A **loan payment** has a principal and interest. The principal goes directly into the equity of your property.
    The more leverage you use, the greater the risk you take.
    **Price does not equal value**. Warren Buffet: Price is what you pay, value is what you get.
    Having cash reserve to cover problems you might face is imperative. The amount depends on a number of factors, such as the number of properties. ~Six month expenses for each unit.
    The more risk, more reward. You need to do the right math to get the right profit.
    **Compound interest** is the profit earned by reinvesting profits.
    You should set-up a plan: I.E Buy each unit at 80% of the actual value, force 10% appreciation the first year through improvements, property must appreciate at least 3% each year after year one.
    A solid team can help you turn your from a new investor into a successful real estate mogul.
    Most important factors to analyze: Cash flow and appreciation.
    **Buy an hold investor**.
    The key to calculating income is **estimating the fair market rent**. Determined by the market. Will depend on location, bedrooms and bathrooms, amenities (parking, aircon), size, ...
    When a unit is vacant, try to bump up the rent. If the market will bear the increased price. If in a week or so there are no takers, start easing down the price until it rents to find the market rate. Too many applications? Rise the rent.
    You should include in your math a 5% or so **vacancy rate**. A 5%-15% **repairs** rate depending on the age, and also **capital expenditures** (replacing roof, plumbing, windows, paint...) This is fixed cost and will be a bigger percentage if it's a low income rental.
    **Cash on cash return on investment (CoCROI)** it shows the yield our money is making us based on the cash flow. It ignores appreciation and loan pay-down). It lets you compare this investment against other investments, like stock market or mutual funds. It is the ratio between how much cash flow we received over one year and how much money we invested it.
    **CoCROI=Total annual cashflow/total investment**.
    **The 50% rule**: Rental properties expenses tend to be 50% of their income, not including mortgage principal and interest payment. **Cash flow = Income * 0.5 - Mortgage**
    **The 2% rule** is the ration between rental income and purchase price. If the monthly rental income is less than 2% of the purchase price, it's probably a bad deal. But depends on the local market/area.
    To find a good deal you should look at 100 homes in screen, offer on 10, and get only one accepted. If you get more than one accepted, you are offering too much. Don't be afraid to submit a lot of offers.
    Understanding the location you are investing is key to being successful with the investment. **Rate locations A to D**. Class A are locations with newest buildings, hottest restaurants, best schools. Class C are lower income area with 30 year old homes or more. Class D is where you wouldn't travel alone. A lot of crime or drugs, high unemployment. Avoid D. Don't buy a property in a neighborhood that has an unsolvable problem. The property will be difficult to rent, the tenants will trash the house, you will have to deal with evictions late rent.
    Check the price to rent ratio for each location to determine the areas of higher yield.
    Focus on the deals that need work. Homes that have some problems are avoided by most of the buyers, so it's easier to get a deal.
    Paint the home before renting it, it increases the value. Kitchens and baths sell houses. Consider fixing them. Sometimes it's easy and cheap to transform an old kitchen into a newer one with some painting and tails.
    Make your offer without many **contingencies**. You can specify anything as contingency. Typical ones are inspection and funding.
    Use a professional **inspector** to check out the property before buying it. They will make a details report of the state of the property.
    You can show the seller you are serious about the offer by **adding more as earnest money** that is required. He will be more likely to accept. If the offer is turned down, you can counteroffer again a bit more. If the initial offer is accepted, you probably offered too much. **A little back and forth is a good thing**.
    You need to be **prepared to walk away**.
    Find the real motivation for selling the property, it can help in the negotiation.
    Appeal to the math in your negotiation, Expenses will be X, I can only rent it for Y, I need to pay Z to get W% return.
    Ask the seller what is the lowest price. Then go lower.
    **Due diligence** is the process you go after getting an offer accepted but before taking ownership. Real estate agents an sellers diminish the negatives about a property and highlight the positives. Do not do your own inspection, hire a professional. The professional will do a comprehensive report about the status of the property.
    Keep your business expenses separate from your personal account.
    You will need to do bookkeeping, use QuickBooks or an excel for accountability and help with tax return.
    Bad tenants are the only ones attracted to bad properties. Snapp as many photos as possible before renting it to.
    Manage effectively, increase income, decrease expenses.

    ** ow to think and dream creatively**: 1. Believe it can be done, it sets the mind in motion to solve the problem. Eliminate the word impossible. 2. Become receptive to new ideas. Top success is reserved for the **I can do it better** kind of person. Everyday, spend 10 minutes thinking how you can do a better job.
    **Capacity is a state of mind** how much we can do depends on how much we think we can do.

    How you will change depends on your future environment.
    Young people make plans to conquer the unknown, to be leaders, attain positions of high importance, do exciting and stimulating things, be wealthy famous. when we grow suppressive influences make us settle for less.
    There are three groups of people: 1) The majority of the people think they don't have what it takes, that success is for other lucky people. 2) Those who surrender partially. They work, they plan but after a few years they decide that greater success is not worth the effort. Deep down they are not satisfied because they know they have surrendered. 3) Those who never surrender. It's the top 2%, people who live and breathe to success. It is the happiest group because it accomplishes the most.
    The most successful people are also the most humble and ready to help.
    **People with most exciting off-the-job-life is always more successful** than a person who lives in a dull, dreary home situation.
    1) Do circulate in new groups. Make new friends, join new organizations. 3) Select friends who have views different than yours.

    The person who is most active talking, is rarely the most successful one.

    **Grow the action habit**: Be an activationist, be a doer, not a don't-er. Don't wait until conditions are perfect. They will never be. Expect future obstacles and difficulties and solve them as they arise. Ideas alone won't bring success, you need to action upon them. Use action to cure fear and gain confidence. Think in terms of now. Tomorrow, next week are synonymous with the failure word, never. Start doing things now, don't get ready for it.

    **Use goals to help you grow**: The important thing is not where you were or are, but where you want to get.

Mr Money Mustache Blog
    **Car frugality**: Try to combine all your driving errands into the trips you already do for work. Cars are for inter-city travel, not for quick trips to the store.
    Technology changes exponentially. The hottest products are in the stores, and the hottest ones from just a few months ago are abandoned in people's drawers and garages. You almost NEVER need to buy anything new, because you can have an almost-new item for 25-50% of the cost out of one of these drawers. People are so accustomed to buying new things, that they are willing to almost give away their used things even when they are barely used.
    Early retirement is not about having a lot of money. It's about having choices. It's about finding yourself. You need to discard that old stuffy image of retirement where couples buy an RV and take up touring the country, or just sit around at home and occasionally play golf. Early retirement is a lifestyle and it is unique for everyone. I can choose hikes instead of manicures and camping trips instead of Disneyland, and I know that I am much happier for it.

    **Christmas**: Institute a No Gifts policy for your own kids' birthday parties and encourage your friends to do the same! At the big gift holidays like Christmas, make a Gift Ceasefire agreement between all willing adults, and concentrate your efforts only on getting fun (but still thoughtful) presents for the kids, who still benefit a bit from Santa-type magic. If you're a wealthy grandparent or a fully grown Mustachian without debts, YOU can afford to buy people gifts, so use your power wisely to get them things that last a lifetime and actually enhance their lives. Like starting a university savings fund for their children or getting them a set of good bikes and a trailer

    You don't have to eliminate your spending on everything to become financially independent. You just have to cut out your waste. And for the most part, buying yourself a home is not a waste.A house is not an asset (unless it is a cash-producing rental property), it's an expense. The best you can statistically expect is for your house value to keep up with inflation: 2% per year or so. Any more than this is just luck, and it can go either direction as we've learned since 2005.

    Many people who have a great deal of wealth do not even live in upscale neighborhoods. 95% of the millionaires of this country are, in fact, what you and I would call Senior Mustachians. They all got there by spending way less than they earn, working hard when they had the chance, and looking to all the outside world like they were actually somewhat low-income.

    So when I bike down the street on my 3-year-old $299 commuter bike, wearing ripped jeans and a plaid construction shirt, and someone passes me in a brand new BMW 7-series, I actually get to feel pity for that person and their very-likely poor financial situation. That is true joy.

    **Buy a workout rack** Having this simple but complete weight set has allowed me, my wife get amazing muscle-blasting workouts at all hours of the day, on weekends, holidays, during snowstorms, whatever. At a savings of $25.00 per month each!

    I don't budget. It seems inefficient to me. I can work for many people. But I have had greater success breaking it down to a much smaller level: the individual transaction. As a Mustachian you will learn to THINK before you make EVERY money transaction and optimize that transaction right at that moment. In short, you just don't buy ANYTHING until you've really thought about it. This eliminates most purchases outright. Then you optimize the remaining purchases so they cost about 75% less than normal whenever possible. The resulting trail of credit card statements is quite boring, not really worth adding up or reviewing. The real fun is in trying to get the net worth statement and the investment accounts to look better over time

    Companies that have recently been enjoying growing profits, and are flashy and exciting and thus expected to see continued profit growth, are rewarded with higher P/E ratios and thus higher stock prices. A good example of a currently stylish company is Google, which trades at a P/E of 20 (Google's shares are worth $500 each, because their earnings per share are $25, multiplied by the P/E of 20). A less flashy but still very profitable counterexample would be the oil company Chevron. Its share price is only about $100 – earnings per share are $10.30 and the P/E ratio is a nice conservative 9.71. If the P/E ratio were the same as Google, Chevron stock would be worth over $200! This is because investors expect Google to grow much faster than Chevron over the coming years. But since nobody can really predict

    You ask the typical person, even here in the United States: What would you rather have: A gigantic amount of money, but be overweight and/or fragile to the point of needing an elevator to get up to the sixth floor of a building, or just a comfortable amount of money and a gold-quality, healthy energetic mind and body that keeps you jumping around having fun with no health issues until you're 100 years old. But yet the surprising truth is that most people are actually spending most of their time (40+ hours per week) pursuing the Wealth rather than the Health. Then the Wealth is often invested in unhealthy activities like sedentary sightseeing vacations, eating two-thousand-calorie restaurant meals, and gas-powered recreational pastimes like motorboating and ATV riding.

    Your **new snack around the house is almonds and walnuts. Bananas with all-natural peanut butter. Apples, mangos, cheese, eggs, beans of all sorts, delicious slabs of fish, chicken, rice, all the olive oil you want, lots of spices, whey protein powder mixed with milk, burritos, cilantro, salads with rich natural oily dressing.. stuff like that. You're not on a low fat diet – you're just on a low-processing diet. Your appetite will adjust to start taking in the right number of calories (instead of too many) as soon as you drop refined flour and sugar from the diet.

    NEVER use a car when a bike or your feet will suffice. Stairs are a gift from the Fitness Gods, so thou shalt run up them whenever thou findest them.

    People, who go out to lunch almost every work day, spending about $12 including food, drink, tax, tip, and car expenses. Plus an hour of otherwise productive time that could be used either to get ahead in their careers or go home earlier that night.

    Stock the work fridge with a loaf of whole wheat bread, natural peanut butter, a jar of good jam, some bananas, apples, carrots, cucumbers and any other snacking vegetables, almonds, hot sauce, cheddar cheese, nice yogurt, and even some Beer for when you work late with the coworkers. Also bring your own plate, cup, and cutlery.

    The problem with the Big Income/Big Spender (BIBS) solution to riches is that it is a hollow victory. You are putting effort into earning ever-increasing amounts of income that could have been put into finding a meaningful life for yourself. You are buying shit that builds up

The Bogleheads' Guide to Investing
    Bogleheads are investors who follow the philosophy of John Bogle, founder of Vanguard Group.
    You choose the financial lifestyle that you currently live. **Borrowers** forget about tomorrow and live for today. **Consumers** live paycheck to paycheck. **Keepers** user every paycheck to make a payment toward their future financial freedom.
    It's not how much you make, but **how much you keep**. Don't user net income as measure of economic success.
    Measure of wealth is **net worth**: assets you own minus sum of debts.
    Establish an **emergency fund**, six months of living expenses.
    **Rule of 72**: Divide by 72 the annual rate of return to determine how long it will take an investment to double. I.E an investment that returns 8% every year, doubles every 9 years (72/8 = 9).
    A daily deposit of 54 cents compounds to more than $1 million in 65 years
    Bogleheads are investors, not speculators. Investing is about buying assets and holding them for long periods of time. Odds are against speculators who hope a stock price will rapidly change.
    You can spend less or earn more to find money to invest. We recommends doing both.
    The **sooner you start investing**, the sooner you will reach financial freedom.
    Reducing your spending is financially more efficient than earning more, because of income taxes.
    The habit of **buying a new car** every few years has the potential to decrease your future net worth more than any other buying habit, including credit card debt. It's an expensive bucket of bolts that loses 25% of value each year. Mr Bogle drives a 6 year old car.
    Start your own side work, move to a cheaper house/area.
    **Not all debt is bad debt**: Low interest loands to finance the cost of a home, rental property or education are good examples.
    **Stock** represent ownership interest in a corporation.
    **Bonds** are loans to the bond issuer. So, a bond is a document acknowledging debt that pays interest from time to time.
    **Corporate bonds* are issues by companies that need additional funds.
    Bonds and bond fund values move in opposite direction of interest rates.
    Bonds and bond funds have low correlation to stocks, so bonds are stabilizing force for a portion of your portfolio.
    **Mutual funds** pool money from investors to buy securities. They can be active managed or indexed. A few managers continuously outperform indexes in the long run. Mutual funds offer **diversification**, low minimums, low commissions, liquidity, automatic re-investment.
    **Exchanged traded funds (ETFs)** are mutual funds that trade like stocks on an exchange. ETFs can have lower expenses than mutual funds. However, you need ot use a broker, you pay commissions on each purchase (making DCA inefficient). But it's good for one off purchase and long term holding.
    **Inflation** lowers the purchasing power.
    Factors that determine the amount we need to FIRE: amount we save, current age, retiring age, life expectancy, where we live, expected rate of return, rate of inflation, other sources of income.
    **Recently bias**: projecting recent events in the future.
    **Reversion to the mean (RTM): when some assets outperform, they are more likely to underperform for hte next period.
    Passive investors outperform 70% of investors at any time, and 90% of them over 10 years.
    Don't listen to your gut, stick to your plan. Market timing and chasing hot funds causes underperformance.
    On the short term, the stock market in unpredictable. On the long run, it consistently goes up.
    Just a 1% difference in expenses, makes an 18% difference of returns in 20 years.
    Diversification reduces risk. Identifying the company that will perform best in the long term is impossible.
    **Asset allocation** is the process of dividing our investments among different asset classes to reduce risk and maximize return.
    You should choose amount of stock that will let you sleep well, without worrying about it.
    Choosing the right allocation of stock/bond/cash will be the most important decision you will make.
    **High yield bonds** are junk bonds that provide higher return. We use bonds for safety, using these defeats its purpose.
    **R-squared** is a metric that shows correlation between assets of funds. The higher, the less diversification.
    Past performance does not predict future performance. It's more important to meet financial goals, than to take the chances in the hope of becoming richer.
    **Rebalancing** is the act of bringing our portfolio back to our target asset allocation. It controls risk, and might improve returns, as you are selling high and buying low. You can do it every fixed interval or time, or when the deviation of an asset is higher than a percentage.
    People use **judgment heuristics** that play against themselves, such as fear, greed. Prehistoric man depended heavily on freed and fear to stay alive. People think they are smarter than the rest, ego and overconfidence is another factor.
    We feel twice as much the pain of losing $100 than to making $100.
    **The Endowment effect** make us feel overconfident about the things we know. I.E buying stock from your company.
    **Mental accounting* is treating money differently depending on where it comes from.
    **Anchoring** is sticking to a broker without analysing if he is doing better than the market.
    **Procrastination** and not taking care of your finances is the biggest mistake.

The Millionaire Next Door
    Seven common denominators among those who build wealth: live below their means, spend time building wealth, FI is more important than displaying high social status, their parents did not maintain them, their adult childern are self suficient, they chose the right occupation and are good targeting market opportunities.
    Workers in america account for 2/3 of the millionaires.
    Children learn that high level of consumption is expected of people who spend many years in college.
    **Frugal** is characterized by reflecting economy in the use of resources. The opposite is wasteful.
    Self-made millionaires spend less for suits and high-status items than those who inherited their wealth.
    Our youth are told that buying expensive items is normal behavior for affulent people. People think that if you don't display abundant material possessions you are not successful.
    People who marry a wasteful/hiperconsumer person cannot accumulate wealth.
    Some people work for things, their motivations and thoughts are focused on symbols of economic success. Need to convince others of his success.
    Millionares need a budget. They became millionaires by budgeting.
    Have you noticed those people whom you see jogging day after day? They are the ones who seem not to need job. But that's why they are fit.
    More than half of the **non-budgeters** investing first and spend the balance of their income. **Pay yourself first**.
    If you have a million but earn two millions a year you are an under accumulator of wealth. You won't be millionaire for longer. They show up in the newspaper.
    FI people is happier than people in the same income but financially insecure.
    **expected wealth = one-tenth age * annual income** I.E 0.31 * 20000 = 6K
    It's easier to accumulate wealth if you don't live ina high status neighborhood. More taxes, pressure to decorate, expensive private schools, expensive cars. If you buy your 300K house before becoming millionaire, this day might never come. Will you choose a lifetime of high taxes and high-status living or change your address?
    Never get a mortgage that is more than twice your annual household annual income if you are not rich.
    The earlier you start investing, the bigger the opportunity to accumulate wealth.
    Planning is a strong habit among people who accumulate wealth.
    42% of the millionaires interviewed didn't do any change to their stock portfolio in the past year.
    Products change people. If you buy one status product, you will likely have to buy others to fill up the socially conspicuous puzzle.
    Only 23% of the millionaires own new cars.
    The US is a **consumption oriented society**. It's easier to earn a lot than to accumulate wealth.
    The more dollars adult children are given by their parents, the less money they will accumulate. Never tell your children you are wealthy. Teach them discipline and frugality. Teach them that there are things more valuable than money (health, longevity, loving family, happiness, honesty, respect, integrity...).

The Manager's Path: A Guide for Tech Leaders Navigating Growth and Change
    Managers should help you grow in your career, teach skills, provide valuable feedback, navigate difficult situations, help you figure out what you need to learn, help you understand what is important to focus on and to have that focus.
    **One to one meetings** with your direct manager are essential. They **create human connection** between you both, letting your manager into your life is important. Being able to talk important personal events or noticing if your reporter is under stress is important. Your manager should know that you have life outside work and you should spend some time talking about it. The second purpose is to speak privately about matters with your manager. 1:1s are not status meetings. Come with an agenda for things to discuss. Every week is good frequency.
    Managers should **provide feedback**. If you do something good or bad they should let you know. The sooner the better. Keep track of this feedback, use it in reviews. Public if it's praise, as it reinforces positive behavior in the team, and private if it's criticism.
    Managers should show the larger picture of how your work fits into the team's goals and provide purpose.
    The more senior, the less the personal feedback you will get. You will instead get strategy related input.
    Managers help with **career growth** via training, promotion, and compensation. They should point out to projects, feedback on areas to develop and learn. Good managers know how the promotion system works and help reporters build those achievements and skills. Strong managers have strong networks, they can get ICs attention and feedback from important people.
    ICs should advocate for themselves,
    Use someone who recently onboarded as **onboard buddy**.
    **Interns** are useful to identify potential new hires. Get them to work on a project. Check once a week progress. Plan him to present the work at the end of the program.
    People are not good at saying precisely what they mean in a way that others can exactly understand. We constantly push complex ideas through the eye of the needle of language.
    If you expect your ICs to research things before asking you a question, communicate it.
    Your team should have **onboarding documents** that get updated by new hires.
    It's important to have a strong network of trusted people to share information and ideas.
    The **alpha geek** is driven to be the best engineer in the team and always have the right answer, and to solve all the hard problems. Values intelligence and tech skills above all other traits. Tries to create a culture of excellence but ends up creating culture of fear. They are bad managers.
    **What you measure, you improve**. Help your team succeed by creating clear, focused, measurable goals.
    **Be curious and open-minded**: As you grow in your career, you'll experience a lot of teachable lessons in how things show or should not be.
    The **teach lead** is not a position for a person who wants to deeply focus on the details of her own code. He has 1:1 for career growth, progression towards goals, identify areas for learning. The **scale themselves by delegating** work effectively without micromanaging. They focus on the whole's team productivity and strive to **increase the impact of the team**. Learn how to **partner efficiently with other teams**. Do project management. **Understand business requirements and translate into software**.
    You sometimes have to **go slow in order to go fast in the future**.
    **Balancing is one of the core challenges**. Doing things you know and like, with others you don't.
    Avoid being constantly interrupted by meetings. Put **meetings early or late in the day concentrated**. Stay concentrated for long stretches of time.
    **Project management** is the act of breaking a complex end goal into smaller pieces. Identifying what can be done in parallel, and tease out the unknowns. Break down the work into smaller pieces.
    **Principles of the Agile Manifesto** Individuals and interactions over processes and tools. Working software over comprehensive documentation, customer collaboration over contract negotiation, responding to change over following a plan.
    Look for self-regulating processes.
    Working on the less exciting parts of the codebase can teach you a lot about where the process is broken.
    Some decisions need to be made by you, others delegated to more people with more expertise, and others needs the whole team to decide.
    You represent the team in the meetings, communicate their needs and bring information from the meeting back to the team.
    Speak in team meetings, speak in meetups, and get practice standing up in front of an audience.
    Main tasks for managing people: Holding regular 1:1s, giving feedback on careers growth and progression, identify areas of learning. Do them in the morning before things get busy. 1:1s are creative discussions to discuss whatever the IC thinks its important. 1:1s for early career employees can be used for informal feedback and coaching. Talk about family, friends, hobbies, pets. Get to know their career so far, ask them log term goals. Show that you care and are invested in helping them now and in the future. You can do 1:1s as walking meetings, or over a coffee or launch to get out of the office.
    **Ask your ICs**: Why did you decide to work here? What are you excited about? Any manager behaviour I should avoid? An career goal I should know? any surprises since you joined? Ask them how their trip/weekend was, humanize Ics. Teams that are friendly and happier produce better results. Do you want to work with people you hate?
    Have onboarding documentation. Every new hire gets up to speed and has to update it.
    Get as much feedback as possible from new hires in the first 90 days. Fresh eyes see things that are hard for established members to see.
    **To-DO list meetings** team comes with a list of objectives to cover, in order of importance. Updates are given, decisions are made or discussed, planning happens.
    Problems in the workplace need to be dealt with or put aside. Avoid repeatedly focusing on drama.
    **Progress reports** when you are managing managers you can have meetings to get the status of projects being worked.
    Avoid **micromanagement**. Sometimes you will have to do it for projects assigned to junior engineers. Avoid it as habit. You can ask how they are measuring success and make it visible to you as ongoing basis. If the team is making progress, the system is stable, and PM happy, we are good. Team should know and understand the quarter goals, year, etc...
    Delegation is not abdication. You are still expected to ensure the project succeeds.
    Create a culture of **continuous feedback**. Managers and peers should note when things are going well and raise issues as they happen. Every week there should be one thing you can recognize about someone in your team. If a misstep happens, provide the feedback quickly.
    Managers are responsible for **providing feedback**, aggregating it and summarizing it to the person. Account for the whole year. Keep notes. Use concrete examples. Spend time on accomplishments and strengths. Keep areas of improvement focused. Don't report blindly all feedback. Filter out the useful one. Feedback should indicate skills needed to expand to promote. Avoid big surprises, if someone underperforms they should know already.
    As a manager, you need to learn how the game is played in your company.
    **Firing underperformers** is hard. You write a performance improvement plan, with objectives and a fixed period of time. Sometimes it's not accomplishable and it's a nice way to give the person time to look for another job. There should be no surprises, you should have provided and recorded feedback many times.
    As a manager, you need to stay enough in code to understand bottlenecks, and process problems.
    Infrequent releases can hide pain points such as poor tooling, heavy manual testing, features too big.
    The **bullshit umbrella* your team should be able to focus on what needs to be done, without being distracted by the wider drama, politics, changes happening in the company. Help your team focus on the key important goals.
    Managers are accountable for team's progress.
    Create a **data driven team culture**. You should know how much time we spend working on features, QA, outages.
    A manager should **think two steps ahead** and know where the product roadmap is going.
    Run **retrospective meetings** for the day to day processes or every release. Is the team happy about how they get the requirements, do they feel good about the code quality?
    You should have an environment where disagreement works itself out, not one where we pretend disagreement doesn't exist.
    Setup processes to **depersonalize decisions**. Start with understanding risk, goals, etc... Someone on the team owns making the decision.
    The **brilliant jerk** is a toxic employee that produces outsized results, but is ego-driven, creates a mix of fear and dislike.
    You will have to do **project management** work: estimate if the team can take certain projects, decide which ones to take, and push back. You will have to decide when to push for a hack implementation and when to hold back for the right one.
    Pairing with engineers when you join a company is useful to understand the rhythm.
    **Managing managers** involve headcount management and planning, career growth and training for the org, ensuring smooth execution of complex deliverables. Very strong communicator, can explain technical concepts to non-technical partners, and business direction to the technology team. Helping teams articulate goals that support the business initiatives. At this point there is probably no time for technical work.
    Need to **differentiate between urgent and important**. I.E preparing meetings to drive them in a health way is important but not urgent. Have agendas upfront. There should be expected procedure and outcomes. If people is doing other things, the meeting is useless.
    Thinking about the future is important and not urgent: Writing job descriptions for roles you are hiring, developing a hiring plan, reviewing a project plan, talk to another manager if there are discrepancies about a project.
    You must **balance breath and depth of thinking**, for knowing the details of your teams today but knowing where you are going and what you need to do to get there.
    Have a mental list of things you are monitoring, things you are trying to fix.
    Delegate tasks that occur frequently.
    Always respond with your manager yes, we can do this project, but will delay something else, etc...
    Durable teams are built on a shared purpose that comes from the company itself, and align themselves with the company's values. They have clear understanding on the company mission.
    We engineers automate so we can focus on the fun stuff.
    Don't answer emails after work, do vacation, don't overwork, do something fun at the weekend to **avoid burnout**.
    **Skip-level meetings** help manager get perspective on the health and focus of the teams. You can treat what do you like most/less, who do you work with recently, who in the team does well, feedback for the manager. You can do it in group, with lunch.
    Managers should be helping ICs succeed, and avoid: unstable product roadmap, errant tech lead, fulltime firefighting mode.

    Managers should make skip manager life easier, so they don't have to focus on the details but only on the big picture.
    If the team does a lot of fire fighting, the manager should put together a plan to tackle this. If needed hire more.
    As a manager don't try to make everyone happy, align with your manager and org.
    Ask your ICs about the daily work they do you should understand it, be curious. Focus on the areas you are less comfortable with.
    **handling roadmap** split it into series if small deliverable. Don't over-promise. Dedicate 20% of the time to tackle technical debt.
    Pick unknown areas and ask an engineer to explain it to you.
    Attend post-mortems. Keep up with the business trends.
    Ask the engineering team where the pain points are. Find productivity bottlenecks. Study how technology landscape might change in the future.
    Communicate bad news personally in 1:1 if possible not to big groups or impersonal emails.
    Ask for advice to people. Don't be afraid to repeat yourself. Ask if there is more you can do to help. Actively look for coaching and skill development in other places.
    Learn to communicate to non technical managers. Skill the tech details.
    You are the model for your team: if you yell they will learn yelling is ok. If you apologise they will learn that it's ok to make mistakes.
    Don't share worries that they can't do anything about to mitigate.
    Take as much time as possible to learn about your employees life. They should feel they belong to a group that cares about them.
    Instead of being angry, get curious when things don't go well.
    You want a team that can take risks and make mistakes. You need a bit of time of small talk to get sense of belonging and confidence.
    **Apologise** when you screw up. Do it honestly and briefly. The goal is to show you are aware your behaviour has impact on others.
    **be curious** learn how to turn disagreement into honest questioning.
    Learn how to hold people accountable without making them feel bad.
    You should know **how you measure success**, if the team has the capabilities to success and you should provide feedback.
    Learn and work on **softening your rough edges**. Building a culture of trust takes time.
    The company will need **structure** to scale up both code and people. Failure is a good place to investigate and identify where our structure needs to change.
    **culture** is how things get done without having to think about it.
    Give **shout outs** for keeping it dope.
    Use **performance reviews** to align and evaluate team members values and company values. Reinforce desired behaviour in a positive way.
    Teams should be Cross functional: one team with backend fronted and PM working on the same product.
    **Code review** is a valuable tool to ensure stability and long term quality of the codebase.  You want it to be straightforward and efficient since it's in the critical path. Be clear about the expectations. It's a socialization exercise so everyone gets familiar with the code.
    **Outage postmorten** or learning review is not used to determine the cause but to learn from the incident. Don't blame. Some takeaways might be more important than others.
    **Architecture reviews** is to familiarize the changes to the appropriate group.
    Great managers are masters of **working through conflict**. Take your ego out of the conversation. To find a clear view of a complex situation, you must see past your interpretations.
    Use **curiosity** to get away from your ego. Write a page or two every day of free flow thoughts to clear your mind.
    Investigate your emotional reactions, when they make it hard to see what is going on, and learn from them.

Extreme Ownership
    The only meaningful measure for a leader is whether the team succeeds or fails. **Effective leaders** lead successful teams that accomplish their mission ans win.
    A leader takes **complete ownership** of everything that goes wrong with his team. Even if it means getting fired. This will help you make the right decisions to win.
    If a IC doesn't do what they should, it's the leader responsibility for not explaining the strategic mission, developing tactics, or securing the training etc... to successfully execute.
    You must **remove individual ego** and personal agenda and have extreme ownership to succeed. It's all about the mission.
    Own every failure or shortfail, look for solutions to prevent it.
    Leaders must be able to detach from the tactical mission and understand how it fits into strategic goals.
    You must understand the decisions coming from your leadership so you can explain and make sense of them.
    **Ego clouds** disrupt everything: planning process, ability to take good advice, and accept constructive criticism.
    Check your ego and **operate with high degree of humility**.
    Every Ic fault is your fault. Maybe documentation wasn't clear, procedures, etc..
    Departments and groups must work together towards the same goal.
    Leaders must start by understanding the mission, analyzing it and giving directives to the team.

Invicto: Logra Más, Sufre Menos
    **La calidad de tu vida, depende de la calidad de tus pensamientos**. Los estoicos ven la filosfía como una guía para la vida.
    Los estoicos buscan la felicidad a través de **la virtud y la tranquilidad**. Uno nos dice como actuar, y el otro evita el sufrimiento emocional.
    El estoicismo es un sistema operativo mental que permite mejorar cómo te ves y entender el origien de tus pensamientos.
    Los esticos destacan cuatro virtudes: **la sabiduría, la justicia, el coraje, y la disciplina**.
        **La sabiduría** es la capacidad de observar la realidad de manera racional y objetiva.
        **El coraje** es actuar con virtud independientemente de las consecuencias.
        **Disciplina** es el autocontrol y la fuerza de voluntad. Nos permite superar los problemas. Es de ayuda para el que posee un mediocre ingenio.

    Los estoicos no proponen dejar de sentir, sino tener **herramientas para minimizar el impacto de las emociones negativas** y poder perseguir lo que queremos.
    **La mente es una fortaleza**, que sigue en calma a pesar de las batallas externas.

    El objetivo del estoicismo es mantener un estado mental de **emociones positivas predominantes, y de gratitud por la vida**.
    **No deberíamos tener miedo a la muerte, sino a no empezar nunca a vivir**.

    **Tú tienes el poder sobre tu mente**, no los eventos externos. Entiendo esto y encontrarás tu fuerza.

    **Los problemas son parte de la vida**, cuando resuelves uno llega otro. El objetivo no es eliminarlos, **sino actuar correctamente y la paz mental**.

    Hay que distinguir entre lo que depende de nosotros y lo que no. Hacer depender nuestro bien estar de las cosas fuera de nuestro control es una de las principales causas de insatisfacción.  **Solo nuestras percepciones y acciones están bajo nuestro control**. Tienes control sobre las acciones (comer bien), pero no control total (enfermar). Hay que enfocar nuestro esfuerzo y energía en aquello que depende de nosotros. Preucuparse por las cosas que no están bajo nuestro control solo genera ansiedad y frustración.
    Centrar tus **esfuerzos y pensamientos en lo que controlas** maximiza la probabilidad de alcanzar el resultado deseado.
        **El destino guía a quien lo acepta, y arrastra a quien lo rechaza**. Seneca. Ejemplo: un perro atado a una carreta puede disfrutar del camino o resistirse. Ambos le llevarán al mismo destino pero la experiencia del viaje será distinta.
    Al dar la bienvenida a todo lo que ocurren en nuestra vida, evitamos ser poseídos por rabia o ira.
    Se trata de hacer lo mejor que podamos, con lo que tengamos, en vez de lamentarnos por lo que nos ha tocado.
    Acepta tu realidad, y céntrate en lo que puedes controlar.

    Los estoicos reconocen que la vida es preferible a la muerte, la salud a la enfermedad, la riqueza a la pobreza. Debes perseguir lo preferido, pero no ligar tu felicidad a conseguirlo.
    El sabio no necesida nada, pero lo aprovecha todo. El necio cree que necesita muchas cosas, pero las usa todas mal. Si necesitas menos, eres más libre.

    Los estoicos **no consideran el dinero como algo malo**, pero reconocen que es mejor vivir con poco y mente tranquila, que con abundancia y mente distorsionada. El problema no es el dinero, sino precuparte por él, tanto si te falta como si lo tienes.

    Alertan del peligro de desarrolar un paladar muy esquisito, ya que dejarás de disfrutar de alimentos básicos o comidas sencillas.

    Una vez superada la moderación, el placer es causa de dolor. La búsqueda constante del placer no puede ser la base de una buena vida.

    Puedes disfrutar del lujo o placer artificial, pero no convertirte en su esclavo. El placer sin moderación genera vicio. **Hay una delgada línea entre placer y dolor**.

    Una de las principales **causas de sufrimiento es que valoramos más lo que nos falta que lo que tenemos**. Recomiendan **pasar menos tiempo pensando en lo que deseamos**.

    Gran parte de nuestro sufrimiento está causado por echos imaginarios. Nos adelantamos a los acontecimientos y sufrimos el doble. Arruina el hoy por el mañana.

    La **ansiedad** se produce por intentar controlar aquello que no depende de nosotros. Toma medidas preventivas, pero una vez hecho la ansiedad ya no aporta nada.

    Si haces algo bueno con esfuerzo, el esfuerzo pasa rápido pero lo bueno permanece. Si haces algo malo por placer, el placer pasa rápido pero lo malo permanece.

    Tenemos control total sober nuestras acciones, entender esto es una **potente vacuna contra el victimismo**.

    **Sofisticación** es aquello que se aleja de lo sencillo y natural. Hay que vivir con moderación, para vivir apegado a la naturaleza. La moderación y sencillez contribuyen a una buena salud y buena vida.

    El único esclavo es aquel encadenado por sus pasiones y azotado por sus emociones. Sin control, nuestra mente es la peor prisión.

    Todo es más tolerable si lo vemos como sucesión de momentos que vienen y van, en lugar de interpretar nuestra situación como algo permanente.

    Los estoicos no trataban de convertir la gente al estoicismo. No expliques tu filosofía, vívela.

    Las primeras impresiones con frequencia no son reflejo de la realidad. Desconfía de tus emociones. Algo que te haga sentir bien/mal no tiene por que ser bueno/malo. I.E Ver un perro puede causar alegria o miedo segun tus experiencias. **Explora tus emociones, no las suprimas**. Detrás de cada emoción hay una lección.

    Si actúas y sale bien, tendrás un beneficio, si sale mal un aprendizaje. Conviertes fracaso en éxito si aprendes de él.

    **Evita la ira**. Si alguien se cuela en tu carril, pon en perspetiva tu situación, quizá tiene mucha prisa, cuales son las consecuencias? 1 min tarde? **Evita tu primera reacción y piénsalo**. Calma la mente y evalua con tranquilidad las opciones disponibles.

    Nuestro cerebro es my sensible a **variaciones percibidas en la posición jerárquica social**. La supervivencia dependía de la capcidad de colaboración con los demás.
    La **vergüenza nos hace acatar las normas sociales**. Limitando las acciones egoístas que dañan al grupo. Ser distinto en cualquier sentido suele producir vergüenza. Ser distinto en cualquier sentido suele producir vergüenza, al creer inconscientemente que violamos convenios tribales. Todas nuestras acciones deberían estar guiadas po la virtud, no por convenios sociales.
    Al entender que nada malo ocurre por sentir un poco de vergüenza, esta emoción pierde fuerza. Ríete de tus propios errores.

    **La envidia** puede ser positiva si sabes aprovecharla. Da información sobre las cosas que deseas y las personas que admiras.

    **La gratitud** sirve para evitar la envidia.

    Hay las siguiented **distoriones cognitivas**:
        **Razonamiento emocional**: asumimos que nuestras emociones son un reflejo fiel de la realidad.
        **Catastrofizar**: Magnificamos nuestros problemas.
        **Generalizar con exceso**: Asumimos que ciertos eventos puntuales son representativos del global.
        **Pensamiento blanco y negro**: éxito o fracaso. La realidad es compleja y casi siempre hay una gran gamma de grises.
        **Filtro negativo**: Aspectos negativos nos impiden ver lo positivo.
        **Descalificación de lo positivo**: Tendemos a minimizar lo positivo.
        **Adivinar el futuro**: Asumimos que la experiencias pasadas predicen las futuras. O **Profecía autocumplida** si empiezas una dieta con pocas aspectativas es probable que no la termines.
        **Lectura del pensamiento** Asumimos que sabemos lo que otros piensan sin tener pruebas. Sin evidencia, asume que la ignoracia tiene más que ver que la mala fe.
        **Etiquetamiento**: Evaluamos personas a partir de incidentes muy concreto.

    Detecta tus **pensamientos automáticos** y evalua si es una hipótesis que puede no ser cierta o si se ajusta a la realidad.

    Debemos definir los valores por lo que queremos vivir, para así poder evaluar si nuestros comportamientos los reflejan. **Sabiduría** el aprendizaje constante puede ser un valor.  **Coraje** hacer lo correcto a pesar del miedo. **Justicia** ayudar a los demás. **Disciplina** Cualquier propósito requiere esfuerzo y disciplina. Debes marcarte objetivos específicos alineados con estos valores.

    El tiempo es la materia prima de la vida, un recurso no renovable. Para los estoicos nuestro bien más preciado. El dinero perdido se puede recuperar, el tiempo malgastado no.
    Nadie en su lecho de muerte desearía haber pasado más tiempo viendo la tv. Sinó, haber logrado algo de lo que te sientas orgulloso o dedicar más tiempo a lo que valoras.
    En los malos momentos de la vida, es cuando es más importante contar con una buena filosofía.
    No hagas tus problemas mayores al añadir tus quejas. El dolor es más tolerable si no le añades nada. Séneca.
    La **culpa solo produce ira**, una de las emociones más destructivas.
    Nuestra felicidad depende más de nuestra disposición mental que de las cosas que nos ocurren. Tendemos a caer en la **felicidad condicional**: seré feliz cuando resuelva este problema. Improvable ya que vendrán otros. La **felicidad viene de dentro** y es ajena a todo lo externo.
    No trivialices tus problemas, pero da la **perspectiva adecuada a tus problemas**.
    Vemos los eventos de manera muy distinta cuando nos ocurren a nosotros que a otros. Piensa que consejo darías si le hubiera pasado a otro.
    La mente puede **dar la vuelta a cualquier problema** y usarlo para su propósito.
    Una **vida con propósito es una vida con estrés**. Aprende a gestionarlo.
    La libertad no se logra satisfaciendo deseos, sino eliminándolos.
    La **distancia congnitiva** nos permite separarnos de los objetos que nos tientan. Es la visión idealizada de estos que nos tienta. I.E el vino es solo zumo de uva. No somos nuestros pensamientos. Pregúntate si hay otra forma de interpretar nuestra realidad. Imagina que le pasa a otra persona.

    Diseña un entorno a tu medida, para reducir la disciplina, y dedicar energía a cosas productivas.
    Compramos cosas que no necesitamos para impresionar a personas que no estimamos.
    Acepta las opiniones de los demás, no las aceptes sin juzgar previamente. Tómate con humor los ataques personales. Acepta tus defectos, así nadie los podrá usar en tu contra.
    Las personas actuan más por ignorancia que por malicia.
    Si la persona que te critica no es de tu admiración o modelo a seguir para ti, puede que se haya equivocado.
    Los cambios reales empiezan desde dentro, si otra persona no siente la capacidad de cambiar, se opondrá a cualquier fuerza externa.
    Sé impaciente con las acciones pero paciente con los resultados.
    Imaginar la pérdida de algo valioso nos ayuda a apreciarlo en vez de darlo por sentado. Todo lo que tenemos es un préstamo del universo que puede ser reclamado en cualquier momento.

    No es la muerte lo que debemos temer, sino nunca haber vivido. La vida es una enfermedad terminal, se consciente que morirás. La muerte es la no existencia, has vivido pocos años con respecto la historia de la humanidad pero no te precupa, por que debería preucuparte la muerte?

    Vive para vivir, no vivas para comer. El **ayuno** ayuda a volver a gozar de los alimentos simples, y saber que puedes aguantar sin comer.

    Haz **duchas de agua fría** ayuda a resistir el frío.

    **Prescindir temporalmente** de las cosas normales hace que las volvamos a apreciar.

    **Visualizar las cualidades** de las personas que nos inpiran nos ayuda a mejorar nuestro comportamiento. Cuando tengas un problema complejo pregúntate **que haría esta persona**. Actua como si tu **conducta fuera siempre pública** y escrutinada.

    Cuando tengas un problema, piensa si en diez años va a importar.

    Pensar en nuestro pequeño papel en el universo es liberador. Nos ayuda a poner nuestros problemas en perspectiva, y evitar que los éxitos se nos suban a la cabeza o los fracasos nos hundan. No debemos perder la tranquilidad por eventos sin importancia.

    Pensar en **nuestra insignificancia es liberador**.

    Pasar más tiempo en naturaleza mejora la perspectiva de nuestros problemas.

    Pon atención a lo que tienes y sentirás gratitud y bienestar. Pon atención a lo que te falta y sentirás envidia y deseo.

    Reflexionar sobre tus acciones y respuestas a los desafíos diarios te ayudará a conocerte mejor y crecer. Escribir ayuda a clarificar ideas identificar obstáculos y nos convierte en observadores de nuestro pensamiento.

The One Minute Manager
    Leading with collaboration is far more effective than the 'command and control' system.
    Purpose of the team meeting is to let the team make keyu decisions about what they're going to do next.
    People who feel good about themselves produce good results.
    A good manager doesn't make a decision for the IC, he shows them how to make decisions.
    Manager makes sure ICs know what good performance looks like, and what are their goals. Feedback is important.
    **One minute praising**: Manager needs to catch people doing something right, and needs to tell ICs what they did right and how good the manager feels about it, and how it helps, asap. Encourage doing more of the same.
    **One minute redirects**: Everybody is a learner, things change quick. It helps people learn, as what they need to do differently. Make sure the goal set is understood, take responsability otherwhise. Remind the IC what he did wrong, tell him how you feel about it and the impact it has. Remind him that he is better than the mistake and that he has confidence and trust he will do better in the future.
    In order for managers to look good in the org, they need to catch ICs doing things wrong. You have to have a few winners, loosers, and people in the middle.
    Try catching ICs doing things approximately right and praise them.

The Obstacle Is the Way: The Timeless Art of Turning Trials into Triumph
    People blame politicians, other people, bosses, etc.. Only one thing is at fault: our attitude and approach.

    Great individuals and great companies find a way to **transform weakness into strength**.

    **The obstacle in the path becomes the path**.

    Many of our problems come from having too much: rapid technological disruption, junk food, traditions that tell us how we are supposed to live our lives. Abundance can be its own obstacle.

    Overcoming obstacles a discipline of three critical steps: 1) how we look at our specific problems, attitude or approach. 2) The energy and creativity with which we break them down and turn them into opportunities 3) cultivation and maintenance of inner will that lets us handle struggle.

    **Obstacles are not to be expected but embraced**.

    **Perception** is how we see and understand what occurs around us. Where one person sees a crisis, another can see opportunity. Where one loses control of emotions, another one can remain calm.

    Humans keep biological baggage, we perceive threats that no longer exist.

    **Discipline** lets you see the advantage and proper course of action in every situation, without panic or fear.

    Situations are not good or bad, some people might perceive them as so. There is only the **story we tell ourselves about what it means**. Don't let negativity in, avoid panicking, so you can focus your energy on solving problems, rather than reacting to them.

    Even in prison, deprived of nearly everything, some freedoms remain. Your mind remains your own.

    Many problems come from applying judgment to things we don't control.

    Most of the problems come from subjectivity. When someone explain us their problem we see clearly the solution and can help because we can be objectives.

    If someone or a crowd intimidates you, picture them nude having sex.

    **Perspective is everything**. What we tell ourselves what an obstacle means determines how daunting and trying it will be to overcome.

    **What is up to us**? Our emotions, judgments, creativity, attitude, perspective, desires, decisions. **What isn't?** Everything else:weather, economy, circumstances, trends, disasters...

    You live in the current moment. No matter if you have a good or bad job, bad economy etc.. the moment is the moment. The more you embrace it the easier it is to face and move.

    If you think more about the obstacle than in the goal, which will triumph?

    **Adversarial growth** what doesn't kill me makes me stronger is a fact. The struggle against an obstacle inevitably propels the fighter to a new level of functioning. Each obstacle we overcome makes us stronger for the next one.

    In life, it doesn't matter what happens to you or where you came from. It matters wha you do with what happens and with that you've been given.

    We must all **either wear out or rust out**.

    **Defeat is nothing but education**. The first steps towards something better.

    **Failure is an asset** if you learn something new.

    Make difficult obstacles resolve themselves. I.E an impenetrable fortress can be turned into a prison when surrounded.

Almanack of Naval Ravikant
    Character
        Questions nearly everything
        Thinks from first principles
        Changes his mind regularly
        Laughs a lot
        Thinks holistically
        Thinks long term
        Doesn't take himself too seriously

    Learn to sell and to build.

    Study microeconomics, game theory, psychology, persuasion, ethics maths and computers.

    Reading is faster than listening. Doing faster than watching.


    Making money is not a thing you do, but a skill you learn
    You are not going to get rich renting out your time. You must own equity, a piece of a business, to gain financial freedom
    **Wealth** is assets that earn while you sleep.


    Internet enables any niche interest to scale out.
    Escape competition through authenticity.
    We live in an age of **infinite leverage**, and the economics rewards for genuine intellectual curiosity are very high.


    Embrace **accountability** and take business risks under your own name. Society will reward you with responsibility, equity, and leverage.

    Three types of leverage: labor, money and products with no marginal cost of replication.

    You want a leveraged job where you control your time and you're tracked on the outputs. Look for disconnect between inputs and outputs. Creative professions. I.E real estate vs customer service.

    Three ways to retirement: more passive income than burnout, being a monk, loving what you do.

    Ignore people playing **status games**. They gain status by attacking other people playing wealth creation games.

    Play iterated games. All returns in life (wealth, relationships, knowledge) come from **compound interest**. The same happens with reputation, keep building it.

    Wealth creation is an evolutionarily recent **positive-sum game**. Status is an old **zero-sum game**, it's hierarchical, playing it since money tribes. Politics and sports are examples of status game. To be athe winner, there must be a loser. They are a necessary evil but you shouldn't like them.

    **long term game** is a positive sum, we are all baking the pie and make it as big as possible. In the **short term game** we're cutting the pie.

    There are **three big decisions** we make in life: where you live, who you're with, and what you do. These will determine the trajectory of your life, but we spend little time to decide them. If you are going to spend 10 years living in a city, you should spend two years deciding.

    Figure out what you are good at and start helping other people with that.


    **Freedom should be your number one priority**. Freedom to do what you want, freedom from things you don't want to do, freedom from your own emotions or things that disturb your peace. Respect yourself, be a good person.

    **Self-esteem** is the most important outcome in this world. If you don't love yourself, who will? Don't do things you won't be proud of, they will damage you.

    Do hard things to create **your own meaning in life**.

    Money is not going to solve all your problems, but it will solve all your money problems. It will remove things that could get in the way of being happy, but **it's not going to make you happy**.

    In school, work and life, you trained yourself to be a **high-anxiety person**, now you need to learn how to be happy.
    The direction you're moving matters more than how fast you go, specially with leverage.

    Your desires collide with reality. This is why it's easy to provide advice to friends (this girl wasn't for you, get over it. Try to acknowledge things publicly. Not hiding it to others you won't delude from what is going on.

    Your ego is constructed in your first two decades by environment, parents and society. Then we spend the rest of our life trying to make our ego happy.

    Tension is who you think you should be. Relaxation is who you are.

    **You need habits to function**. Try to identify habits you acquired when you were young and are not of your service. Does it make you happy or healthier? Any belief you took in a package (Democrat, Catholic) should be re-evaluated. **Creating identities** labels you and locks you form seeing the truth. Speak without identity.

    Praise specifically, criticize generally. Warren Buffett.
    If you have a criticism of someone, then don't criticize the person, but the general approach or activity. Then people's egos don't work against you, but for you.

    **Success is about making mistakes**. Saying what is going to work is hard, it's easier to eliminate what won't work.

    When you are faced with **difficult choices**? Should I marry this person? Should I take this job? buy this house? If you can't decide, then the answer is no. Modern society is full of options.
    If you can't decide, then **take the path that is more painful short term**. Conflict avoidance is trying to push off the short term pain. You want to lean into things with short term pain and long term gain.

    **Genuine love for reading is a super power**. Every piece of knowledge ever written is a fingertip away. Read an hour per day and you will be in the upper 0.%. Most of the books have one point to make, do not feel like you need to finish them.

    Explain what you lean to someone, teaching forces learning.

    We pursue wealth, health and happiness in that order. But their importance is reverse.

    **Happiness** is a skill that can be learnt, like fitness or nutrition. Happiness is the state when nothing is missing, nothing is desired, specially not desiring external things. Our mind shuts down and stops regretting or planning.

    The fewer desires I have, the more I can accept the state of things, the less my mind is moving. Happiness is embracing the present moment, rather than thinking too much about the future or past.

    Happiness is what's there when you remove the sense that something is missing in your life.

    A happy person is not a person that is happy all the time, but a person that effortlessly interprets events without losing innate peace.

    Desire is a contract you make with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want.

    You have two lives, and the second one begins when you realize you only have one. Confucius.

    All man's troubles arise because he cannot sit in a room quietly by himself for 30 mins.

    **Peace is happiness at rest, and happiness is peace in motion**. If you are a peaceful person, anything you do will be a happy activity.

    There are unlimited external problems. The only way to have peace is to give up the idea of problems.

    Try to eliminate as many things you "should do" and do things that make you happy.

    **Expectations drilled by society** into you are the enemy of peace. We are told go work out, go look good, go make money, buy a big house. External multiplayer competitive games. Being happy is internal and not related to any of those, it's a single player game.

    Life is a single-player game, you are born alone and will die alone. You will be gone in three generations and nobody cares, and nobody cared before you came.

    Not eating sugar or watching social media will keep your mood more stable. Avoid dopamine shots (video games, coffee).

    YOu are a combination of your habits and the people you spend more time with. Have low maintenance relationships that make you happy on the long run. Don't hang out with people who engage in conflict.

    If I catch myself judging somebody, I stop and try to see the positive side of it. Don't judge it will make you lonely on the long run.

    All screen activities reduce happiness, all non-screen activities increase happiness. No exception.

    How much of your day is spent doing things out of obligation?

    Politics, academia and social status are all **zero-sum games**. Positive sum games create positive people.

    **For problems you have three options**: You can change it, accept it, or leave it. Don't sit around thinking you'd like to change it but not accepting it. Accept problems, it's ok.

    Try to look at bad things from the positive side. I.E I'll be late to the meeting but I get to enjoy and relax and see the birds rather than in the boring meeting. Or say the universe is going to teach me something, I get to listen and learn.

    Easy choices, hard life. Hard choices, easy life.

    Death is the most important thing that will happen to you. Acknowledge your death and don't run away from it. There is no legacy, or something to leave. Your children will be gone, your works will be dust, civilizations will be dust, planet, etc.. The universe has been around for ten billion years, **your life is a firefly blink in a night**.

    All that matters is you experience your reality as you go through life. Why not interpret it in the most positive way? You don't make anyone a favour not being happy. You are going to die and none of this is going to matter. Enjoy yourself, do something positive, a project you love, laugh a bit, appreciate a moment.

    **Health should be your highest priority** in life, above your happiness, family, or work. First physical health, mental health and spiritual health.

    We have not evolved to live in a perfectly sterile and clean environment. It leads to allergies and untrained immune system.

    Avoid the **combination of sugar and fat**.

    Time spent undistracted and alone, in self-examination, journaling, meditation, resolves the unresolved and makes you mentally fit.

    Don't make decisions and don't judge for 15 mins in a walk.

    **Meditations** is turning off society and listening to yourself. Hiking is walking meditation. Journaling is writing meditation. Sitting quietly is direct meditation.

    **Set up systems, not goals**. Create and environment around you so you are statistically likely to succeed.

    Try to be the most successful version of yourself while working the least hard possible.

    **Anger** is loss of control over a situation. It's a contract you make with yourself to be in physical, mental and emotional turmoil until reality changes. Anger is a hot coal you hold in your hand while waiting to throw it at somebody. Cut angry people off your life.

    **Modern struggle** Lone individuals summoning inhuman willpower, fasting, meditation and exercising. Against armies of scientists and statisticians weaponizing food, screens and medicine into junk food, clickbait news, porn, games, drugs.

    Try everything, test it, be skeptical, keep what's useful, discard what's not.


The Making of a Manager
    Learn by doing. Make mistakes: try something figure out what works and what doesn't, and then you get better. You are a multiplier effect on your collective outcome.
    Manager's **job** is:
        have meetings with reports to help them solve problems
        Share feedback about what is or isn't going well
        Figure out who should be promoted and who should be fired
        Build a team that works well together
        Support members to reach career goals
        Create processes to get work done efficiently
        Make the team successful, make it deliver results and achieve great outcomes
        Hire good individuals

    To increase team's **likelihood of succeeding**:
        Have a real team (clear boundaries, stable membership)
        Compelling direction
        Enabling structure
        Supportive organizational context
        Expert couching

    Your work as manager is divided in three buckets:
        **Purpose** is the outcome your team is trying to accomplish. Or the why, why we work on this instead of anything else we could do?
        Your first job as a manager is to **ensure your team knows what success looks like** and cares about achieving.
        **People**, if you don't have the right people for the right job, you in the environment they can thrive, then you're going to have problems.
        To manage people well, you must develop a trusting relationship with them, understand their strengths and weaknesses and make good decisions about who should do what, coach, and fire.
        **Process** or how your team works together. Running effective meetings, future proofing against past mistakes, planning for tomorrow, having a healthy culture.

    You are judged on your team's outcomes, your job is to do whatever most helps them succeed. If your team lacks key skills, you need to hire or train. Make your individuals thrive.

    **You are accountable** for the decisions you make. Those must be on the best interest of the team. Bad calls loses trust and makes you ineffective.

    Role of a manager can be given or taken away, but leadership is something that must be earned. If your ICs don't trust or respect you, you will have limited ability to influence them.

    When you join the team, make a list of the things that are awesome and the ones that could be better. Spend time calibrating with leadership group's goals, values and processes.

    **Being a coach**: Your job now includes understanding your peer's career goals, projects suited to their strengths and interests, what they need help with, and how they are doing relative to the expectations. Give them feedback about what they are doing well and what they can improve.

    Build a network of leaders with similar role as you outside your org.
    During your first month, ask questions to calibrate expectations
        What does it mean to do a great job vs an overage or poor job?
        Can you share impressions of how you think project Y or meeting X went?
        I noticed X happened the other day, is this normal or should I be concerned?
        What keeps you up at night? Why?
        How do you determine what things to prioritize?

    **Managing is caring**. You must respect and care about your report, there is no faking it. Focus on your report, his career aspirations, how he feels about his work.
    **1:1** should be focused on helping him to be successful:
        **Discuss top priorities**: critical outcomes for your report, how to tackle challenges.
        **Calibrate what great looks like**
        **Share feedback**: what can your report tell you that will make you more effective as a manager?
        **Reflect on how things are going**

    Empower your reports to find answers by themselves. They have more context.
    Questions to ask in 1:1s.
    To **identify** what matters to him:
        What's on top of your mind right now?
        What priorities are you thinking this week?
        What is the best use of your time today?
    To **understand** the root of the problem:
        What does your ideal outcome look like?
        What is hard in getting that outcome?
        What do you care about?
        What do you think is the best course of action?
        What is the worst case scenario?
    To **support** :
        How can I help you?
        What can I do to make you more successful?
        What was the most useful part of our conversation today?

    **Be transparent about your report's performance**. He should have a clear sense at all times of what your expectations and where he stands? He should know at all time what you think of them.
    **Apologize**, admit that you screwed up when you do the wrong thing. People will forget what you did and what you said, but **they will never forget how you made them feel**.
    **Empathy** is the most helpful action in tough times, not advice or answers.
    Reports are more likely to succeed when using their strengths.
    Don't let your worst performers dominate your time.
    If a report is not set to succeed in his current role, support him in moving on.
    
    If a report **wants to be promoted**, make sure you point out the gaps he needs to work on to achieve it.

    The best way to **provide feedback** is to make the listener feel safe, that you care about him and want him to succeed. Always ask after providing the feedback if this makes sense to him. If you are not sure if he understood, ask: let's make sure we are on the same page, what are your takeaways and next steps?
    Template: When I [heard/observed/reflected on] your [action/behavior/output] I felt concerned because ... I'd like to understand your perspective and resolve it.

    **Ask your manager to calibrate yourself**: What opportunities do you see for me to do more of what I do well? What do you think are the bigger things holding me back from having more impact? What skills an hypothetical perfect person should have?

    **Understand yourself at your best and your worst**: Learn about what enabled you to be your best, I.E: sleep at lest 8h. do something productive in the morning to keep motivated, understand the outcome you want, have trust, feel like you are learning and growing.

    **Journal** write something everyday that you are proud of. Exercise 15 mins in the morning to get a sense of accomplishment.

    **What great meetings look like**: Are simple and straightforward, makes you feel: It was a good use of your time, I learnt something new to do my job mor effectively, I have a clear sense of what to do next, everyone was engaged, I felt welcomed.

    Sometimes you have to **disagree and commit* for the sake of moving forward quickly. **Great decision making meetings**: Gets a decision made, include people affected by the decision and other decision makers, presents all credible options with relevant info, include's team recommendation, equal time for each option.

    **Informational meetings**: Get together periodically with your team to highlight important work, share new tools, processes, discuss lessons learned. They should accomplish: team should feel like they learned something useful, conveys key messages, keeps audience attention.

    **Brainstorming meetings**: produces non-obvious solutions, people has time to think of ideas, helps ideas evolve, ends with a clear next steps.

    **Team bonding meetings**: creates better understanding and trust between participants, encourages people to be open and authentic, makes people feel cared about.

    Ensure only the necessary people is in the meetings, it will be more productive.
    After each meeting, send a recap, with action items, and who owns them and ECD.

    **Hiring**: Understand how they have done in the past in similar projects to see how they will perform in the new role. That's why internships are useful, to assess the quality of their output.

    **Interview questions**: kinds or challenges they like, favourite projects, to see what they are passionate about. Ask what they want to do in 3 years to see ambitions. Hardest conflict? to see how they work with other people.

    **80/20 rule** 20% of the work produces 80% of the results. Identify what is this 20%.

    **Cultivate playbooks**: How to run an effective meeting, how to close a new hire, how to complete a project.

How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big
    When seeking truth, look for confirmation of at least two dimensions:
        Personal Experience
        Experience of other people you know
        Experts
        Scientific Studies
        Common Sense
        Pattern recognition
    I.E if after eating popcorn you fart every time a lot, it's a good pattern, not science but still useful.

    Failure always brings something valuable with it.

    The market rewards execution, not ideas.

    Timing is the biggest component of success

    **Goal-oriented people** exist in a state of nearly continuous presuccess failure at best, and permanent failure at worst.
    **System people** success every time they apply their system (they did what intended to do). I.E loosing 2kg vs eating right and exercising regularly.
    A system is something you do on a regular basis that increases your odds of happiness in the long run.

    **We cheat our own future to appear generous today**. I.E skipping exercise to help 1h more at home, eat fast food to help a co-worker with a problem.
    Generous people take care of their own needs first, the world needs you at your best.

    **Increase your energy** I make choices that maximize my personal energy because that makes it easier to manage all the other priorities. That means:
        Exercising
        Eating right
        Avoiding stress
        Getting enough sleep
    It also means having something in life that makes me excited to wake up. If energy is high, quality of work is better, and I can do it faster.
    Personal energy is anything that gives you a positive lift, mentally or physically. I.E shopping in a busy store is an energy killer. I.E I will be late for a dinner because I am finishing this book. That is ok, on the long run they won't care and they will appreciate my positive mood.

    At 6am I am a creator, and by 2pm I am a copier.

    Every time you look at a messy room and think about fixing it, it is distracting you from important thoughts. Tidy up.

    Asshole behaviors:
        Changing the subject to himself
        Dominating the conversation
        Bragging
        Cheating/lying
        Disagreeing with any suggestion
        Using honestly as a justification for cruelty
        Withholding simple favors out of sense of social justice

    You enjoy more work and life when **your attitude is good**. You can control your attitude by manipulating your thoughts, your body and your environment.

    Avoid depressing news, imagine the live you want to trick you into having positive attitude. Your ideas for the future fuel your energy today.

    Smiling makes you feel good. Acting confident makes you feel confident.

    Release your ego long enough to view your perceptions as incomplete or misleading. That gives you freedom to imagine new ways of looking at the world.

    Fake it until you make it. A promotion makes you more confident? Fake it today.

    Where there is tolerance for risk as a kid, there is usually talent. I.E a kid accepting embarrassment risk in front of a crowd might become a good actor.

    Successwise, you're better off being good at two complementary skills than excellent at one. I am not world class on any skills, but all combined give me a good market force.

    People don't use reason for important decisions.

    **To have a good conversation** Introduce yourself, and ask questions until you find a point of mutual interest. Then exploit it.

    When you ask a stranger a personal question you make him feel happy.
    Good **conversation techniques**:
        Ask questions
        Don't complain
        Don't talk about boring experiences (tv shows, dreams,...)
        Don't dominate the conversations, let them talk
        Don't get stuck on a topic
        Don't talk about medical problems.

    Observe outgoing people and steal their tricks.

    **Exercise your ego** the way you would exercise other muscles. Put yourself in embarrassing situations.

    **Persuasive words and phrases**:
        Because
        Would you mind
        I'm not interested
        I don't do that
        I have a rule
        Thank you (and include why you are thankful I.E surprise/thoughtfulness/...)
        This is just between you and me.

    **Learn to breathe from the bottom of your lungs**.
    Speak like you imagine a confident person would speak.
    Do no 'hem' or 'um' or 'uhs' or anything that disrupts your flow.
    Try forming full sentences in your head before starting them if possible.

    **Important patters of success**
    **Lack of fear of embarrassment**: allows people to be proactive and take challenges when others write off as too risky
    **Education**: The right education means no risk of unemployment
    **Exercise**: Makes people smarter, psychologically braver, more creative, more energetic, and more influential.

    Humor makes average looking people look cute, and uninteresting people seem entertaining.

    The only reasonable goal in life is **maximizing your total lifetime experience of happiness**.

    You need to treat people well to enjoy life.

    The biggest trick for being happy: being able to do what you want when you want. You can control work into pleasure by just choosing when you do it.

    Imagine a brighter future, it lifts your energy and produces happiness.

    **Bad mood* is deficit of: Flexible schedule imagination, sleep, diet or exercise.

    No one wants to believe that the formula for happiness is as simple as daydreaming, controlling your schedule, napping, eating right, and being active every day.

    **Carvings can be manipulated** Once you enjoy the right type of food, you will be healthier.

    List of healthy food: Bananas, protein bars, peanuts, mixed nuts, cheese, whole wheat pasta, broccoli, fish, lettuce, tomatoes, apples, pears, carrots, quinoa, brown rice.

    Use nuts to suppress appetite between meals.

    Pay attention at your energy level after eating certain foods.


Trillion Dollar Coach
    a **manager** is someone from you can learn from and who helps make decisions. Good managers have good processes, make their people accountable and valued by being in the room with your, know how to hire great people, and how to evaluate them and give feedback.

    A manager authority emerges when he establishes credibility with subordinates, peers, and superiors. if you are a great manager your people will make you a leader.

    Manager job is to help people be more effective in their job and to grow and develop in a way that is **consistent with the company needs**.

    Create and **environment that liberates and amplifies energy**.

    Bill would start the meetings by asking people what they did over the weekend, or an informal trip report if they just came back. Ask more than how are kids? but specific how was the soccer game? where is she thinking about college? etc... You can then ask what are the top 5 priorities of the week

    When you listen to people, they feel valued. Use your full attention. Ask questions to get to the real issue.

    Be the person who gives energy, not the one who takes it away.

    Believe in people more than they believe in themselves, push them to be more courageous.

    Don't wait until performance reviews to provide feedback. Do it in the moment.

    **Culture** helps to achieve results.

    Use **meetings* to get everyone on the same page. To get to the right debate, and make decisions.

    Each company or product must have a **set of principles** Then we can use those principles as guide to take decisions.

    If you have to let people go be generous, treat them well, and celebrate their accomplishments.

    Do **reviews** with a set of highlights and lowlights.

    The best teams are the ones with more psychological safety. This starts with trust.

    **Coach job** is to raise self-awareness further and help them see the flaws they don't see for themselves. To be coachable you need to be honest, open to learn, and humble.

    Look for **candidates** that are smart, hard working, learn fast, empathy, team first, have integrity, and grit.

    Taking two people who don't usually work together and assign them a task/project to **build trust**.

    **Annual performance review of Google**: Core attributes (past 12 months, agree/disagree):
        Extraordinary performance
        Exemplified leadership
        Achieved outcomes of Google interest
        Collaborated effectively
        Contributed in meetings

    **Learning forward**: post-morten. Not what happened and who is to blame. But what we will do about it?

    **Strive to win** but always with commitment, teamwork, and integrity.

    Leaders lead when things are going bad, teams are looking for more loyalty, commitment, and decisiveness from their leaders.

    Listen, observe and fill the communication and understanding gaps between people.

    **Build communities** inside and outside work. A place is much stronger when people are connected.


Working Backwards
    long-term interest of share-owners are perfectly aligned with the interest of customers.
    Amazon culture:
        **Customer obsession** instead of competitor obsession
        Willingness to **think long term**, longer investment horizon than most of our peers
        **Eagerness to invent** and willingness to fail
        Taking professional pride in **operational excellence**

    Practical methodologies to make culture actionable:
        **Bar Raiser hiring program**: Ensures that the company continues to acquire top talent.
        Bias for **separable teams run by leaders with a singular focus** that optimizes for speed of delivery and innovation
        Use of **written narratives** instead to slide decks to help understand complex issues.
        Relentless **focus on input metrics** to ensure teams work on activities that propel the business.
        **Working backwards**: from the customer experience.

    **Bar Raising program**: Allows the company with methods to make strongest hires efficiently without cutting corners.

    For each initiative, there is a **single leader** whose focus in that project alone.

    PowerPoint is not the best format to communicate complex information. **Six-page narratives** enables everyone in a meeting to get up to speed quickly on the project that the team is working on.

    Narratives for quarterly and yearly business updates require both the writer and reader to dive deep and insist on the highest standards.

    The Press Release/FAQ process reinforces customer obsession, starting with the customer needs and working backwards from there.


    **Data-driven decision making** and frequent auditing from everyone we work with is the basis for **dive deep** lp.
    Leaders have relentlessly high standards. Many people think these standards are unreasonably high.
    Phrase that appears in LPs and tenets: **Unless you know better ones**. Reminds people to always seek and improve status quo.
    LPs
        Customer obsession
        Ownership
        Invent and Simplify
        Are Right, A lot.
        Learn and Be Curious
        Hire and Develop the Best
        Insist on Highest Standards
        Think Big
        Bias for Action
        Frugality
        Earn Trust: Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical.
        Dive Deep: Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdotes differ, no task in beneath them.
        Hack Backbone, Disagree and Commit
        Deliver Results

    These principals are codified in every one of our core processes (hiring, performance management, planning, operating cadence, career development).
    **Good intentions don't work. Mechanisms do**. If you don't change the underlying condition that created a problem, the problem will recur.

    S-Team goals must be Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Timely (SMART). Only 3/4 of the goals should be achieved. If you do all, it means you set a bar too low. Goals are tracked with status: green (on track), yellow (risks of missing the goal), or red ( will not likely hit the goal).

    **Hiring**: We want missionaries not mercenaries.
    **Confirmation bias** tendency for people to focus on the positive elements that others identify and ignore the negatives, and contradictory signals.
    **Personal bias**: instinct to surround yourself with people who are like you (education, professional experience, life experience).

    **Bar Riser program**: creates a scalable, repeatable, formal process for consistently making appropriate and successful hiring decisions.
    New hires should **raise the bar** be better in one important way than the other members of the team they join. Aimed at reducing personal bias, and maximize data-based hiring decisions.

    Direct reports should now interview a prospective boss. Direct report will learn about the candidate's weaknesses and other employees views on those. During the interview behavioral questions try to understand if they personally have solved similar problems to the ones they will face. We don't ask about their resume.

    **STAR** interview mechanism: what was the situation, what were you tasked with, what actions did you take, what was the result? What the interviewee solved vs the team.

    Only four options: strongly inclined/not inclined. No undecided option. You can't see others feedback until you submitted yours.

    **Velocity**: Measures both speed and direction.

    **Single-Threaded-Leadership**: single person, owns a single major initiative.

    Amazon focuses on controllable input metrics instead of output metrics. Morale is an output metric, freedom to invent an build an input metric. If you clear the impediment of building, morale takes care of itself.

    **Two pizza team**: The team should not be larger than the number of people you can feed with two large pizzas.
        **Be small**: no more than 10 people.
        **Be autonomous**: no need to coordinate with other teams to do work.
        **Be evaluated** by a well-defined fitness function. I.E in charge of adding selection in a product category: how many new items, how many units of those items.
        **Be monitored in real time**
        **Be the business owner**: team takes all the decisions for the product.
        **Be lead by a multi-disciplined top-flight leader**: who must have good business judgement. Also known as **Single threaded leader**.

    **Microservices** Helped assign ownership to code and let teams use API to integrate, reducing integration time.

    **Six-Pager** Is used to describe, review, or propose just about any type of idea, process, or business.

    **Press Release/FAQ**: Linked to the working backwards process for new product development.

    **Ban to PowerPoint**: No matter how complex or nuanced the concepts are, they are presented as small blocks of text, short bullet pointed lists, or graphics. The slide deck alone is insufficient to convey or serve as a record of the complete argument at hand. Also, the stage presence or charm of the presenter cna unintentionally blind the audience's questions/concerns.

    **Written narrative** contains seven to nine times the information density of our typical powerpoint presentation.

    **People read three times faster than the typical presenter talks**.

    **How to conduct a meeting with narratives**: Narratives are distributed at the start of the meeting and read by all in the attendance during the time that would normally be taken by the slide deck presentation (20 minutes aprox). People take notes. Once everyone finishes the conversation about the doc begins. Two-Thirds of the meeting is for discussing what we read. The discussion main points are captured, and become part of the output.

    **Six Pager**: First, it calls out key tenets that the proposal relies upon, a foundational element of the reasoning that led us to make this recommendation. Tenets give the reader an anchor point to evaluate the rest. Strong six-pages will contain FAQs anticipating counterarguments, points of contention, or statements that might be miss-interpreted. Quarterly business review narrative: Introduction, Tenets, Accomplishments, Misses, Proposal for Next Steps, Period, headcount, P&L, FAQ, Appendices.

    **Working backwards**: Start with the customer and work backwards. Systematic way to vet ideas and create new products. Key tenet is to start defining the customer experience and iteratively work backwards from that until the team achieves clarity of thought around what to build.

    **PR/FAQ**: Writing the press release and FAQ before building the product. It let's you focus on the most important issues moving forward. Highlights the customer experience. The most senior attendees speak last to avoid influencing others. it's a living document that will be reviewed and maintained. Parts of the doc:
        Heading
        Subheading: describe the product in one sentence.
        Summary Paragraph: summary of the product and benefit
        Problem Paragraph: describe the problem the product is designed to solve, written from the customer point of view.
        Solution Paragraph: Describe the product in details and how it solves the problem.
        FAQ component

    **Metrics**: We have little direct control over output metrics. It's important to focus on the **controllable input metrics**, activities you directly control, which ultimately affect output metrics. start with the customer and work backwards to align metrics with customer experience.
        Inputs can be selection, price, or convenience. Things you can control and customers care. They measure things that if done right bring the desired result to output metrics.
        Output metrics are things like orders, revenue, and profit. They are important but can't be manipulated in a sustainable manner over the long term.

    **Weekly Business Review (WBR)**: Provides insights about the business. It's a tactical operational meeting to analyzer performance trends of the prior week. First you need to select and define the metrics you want to measure. For that, you need to understand how inputs affect outputs in your system. There's a deck of metrics and each person is responsible for its section. Metrics are monitored in real time. Each service receives an alarm to identify outages instantly. A good deck uses consistent format throughout. During the meeting attendees focus on variances. The goal of the meeting is to discus exceptions and what is being done.

    Business owners own metrics and are prepared to explain variances.

    Operational and strategic discussions are kept separate.


    **Flywheel spins faster**: A Close loop of input metrics driving a single output (growth). Inputs are customer experience, traffic, sellers, selection.  The better customer experience the leads to more traffic, which attracts more sellers, which leads to wider selection, which improves customer experience. The cycle drives growth which lowers cost structure.

    **Correction of errors (CEOs)** process is based on the 5 whys method. When you see an anomaly ask why it happened and iterate with another why? until you get to the underlying factor.

    Mistakes should be acknowledged as a change to take ownership, understand root cause and learn from experience. Culture encourages to discuss mistakes.

    **Andon Cord** When a worker notices a quality problem they can pull a cord that stops the entire assembly line.


The Culture Code
    **Group culture** is one of the most powerful forces on the planet.

    When a **new group starts working on a task together** it seems like they are collaborating, but in fact they are engaged in a process psychologists call status management: Figuring out where they fit into the larger picture: Who is in charge? Is it okay to criticize someone's idea? What are the rules here? Their interactions appear smooth, but their underlying behavior is riddled with inefficiency, hesitation, and subtle competition. Instead of focusing on the task, they are navigating their uncertainty about one another.

    **Inefficient groups**: Spend so much time managing status that they fail to grasp the essence of the problem.
    **Efficient groups**: Stand shoulder to shoulder and work energetically together, move quickly, spotting problems and offering help. They experiment, take risks, and notice outcomes, which guides them toward effective solutions.

    Being smart is overrated, showing fallibility is crucial, being nice is not as important as you might think.

    Simple question that draws the others out, and he listens intently and responds. Energy levels increase; people open up and share ideas, building chains of insight and cooperation that move the group swiftly and steadily toward its goal. **Hey, what do you think of this?**

    All he radiates an idea that is something like, Hey, this is all really comfortable and engaging, and I'm curious about what everybody else has to say. It was amazing how such simple, small behaviors kept everybody engaged and on task.

    **Chemistry**. When you encounter a group with good chemistry, you know it instantly.

    Close physical proximity, often in circles
        Profuse amounts of eye contact
        Physical touch (handshakes, fist bumps, hugs)
        Lots of short, energetic exchanges (no long speeches)
        High levels of mixing; everyone talks to everyone
        Few interruptions
        Lots of questions
        Intensive, active listening
        Humor, laughter
        Small, attentive courtesies (thank-yous, opening doors, etc.)


    **Belonging cues** can't be reduced to an isolated moment but rather consist of a steady pulse of interactions within a social relationship. Their function is to answer the ancient, ever-present questions glowing in our brains: Are we safe here? What's our future with these people? Are there dangers lurking? Modern society is an incredibly recent phenomenon/

    For hundreds of thousands of years, we needed ways to develop cohesion because we depended so much on each other.

    We used signals long before we used language: **You are safe here**.

    A mere hint of belonging is not enough; one or two signals are not enough. We are built to require lots of signaling, over and over. This is why a sense of belonging is easy to destroy and hard to build.


    Words are noise. Group performance depends on behavior that communicates one powerful overarching idea: We are safe and connected.

    Cohesion happens not when members of a group are smarter but when they are lit up by clear, steady signals of safe connection.


    Building an environment that answers basic questions: Are we connected? Do we share a future? Are we safe? Let's take them one by one.


    Team performance is driven by **five measurable factors**:
        Everyone in the group talks and listens in roughly equal measure, keeping contributions short.
        Members maintain high levels of eye contact, and their conversations and gestures are energetic.
        Members communicate directly with one another, not just with the team leader.
        Members carry on back-channel or side conversations within the team.
        Members periodically break, go exploring outside the team, and bring information back to share with the others.


    Particular form of feedback boosts effort and performance so immensely that they deemed it **magical feedback**. Delivers a burst of belonging cues. Actually, when you look more closely at the sentence, it contains three separate cues:
        You are part of this group.
        This group is special; we have high standards here.
        I believe you can reach those standards.


    three types of belonging cues.
        **Personal, up-close connection**: body language, attention, and behavior that translates as I care about you)
        **Performance feedback**: relentless coaching and criticism that translates as We have high standards here)
        **Big-picture perspective**: larger conversations about politics, history, and food that translate as Life is bigger than


    What mattered most in creating a successful team had less to do with intelligence and experience and more to do with where the desks happened to be located.

    I used to like to try to make a lot of small clever remarks in conversation, trying to be funny, sometimes in a cutting way, he says. Now I see how negatively those signals can impact the group. So I try to show that I'm listening. When they're talking, I'm looking at their face, nodding, saying ‘What do you mean by that, ‘Could you tell me more about this, or asking their opinions about what we should do, drawing people out."

    Top salespeople **hardly ever interrupt people**, and then rate them on that scale, you can deliver a powerful message,

    You should open up, show you make mistakes, and invite input with simple phrases like
        This is just my two cents.
        Of course, I could be wrong here.
        What am I missing?
        What do you think?

    Ask questions, listen keenly, and radiate humility.

    You have to hug the messenger and let them know how much you need that feedback. That way you can be sure that they feel safe enough to tell you the truth next time.

    Group shares bad news or gives tough feedback. In these moments, it's important not simply to tolerate the difficult news but to embrace it.

    kind of moment happens all the time in highly successful groups, because it has less to do with thanks than affirming the relationship.

    Thank you for allowing me to coach you. The most powerful person in a group publicly express gratitude for one of the group's least powerful members.

    Whatever you were before, you are a filmmaker now. We need you to help us make our films better. A closer look shows that it creates belonging by placing power and trust in the hands of the people doing the work.

    The key involves the willingness to perform a certain behavior that goes against our every instinct: **sharing vulnerability**. when it comes to creating cooperation, vulnerability is not a risk but a psychological requirement. Teams solving problems in a constant state of vulnerability and interconnection.

    He steered away from giving orders and instead asked a lot of questions: What is wrong with this idea? Who can do this?

    Two important qualities:
        **Warmth**: He had a knack for making people feel cared for.
        **Relentless curiosity**.

    Make Sure **the Leader Is Vulnerable First and Often**: As we've seen, group cooperation is created by small, frequently repeated moments of vulnerability. I screwed that up are the most important words any leader can say.

    Traces any group cooperation norms to two critical moments that happen early in a group life: The first vulnerability, The first disagreement. Are we about appearing strong or about exploring the landscape together? Are we about winning interactions, or about learning together? At those moments, people either dig in and become defensive and start justifying, and a lot of tension gets created

    They interact in ways that make the other person feel safe and supported

    Good listening is about more than nodding attentively; it's about adding insight and creating moments of mutual discovery.

    Skilled listeners do not interrupt with phrases like Hey, here's an idea or Let me tell you what worked for me in a similar situation because they understand that it's not about them. They use a repertoire of gestures and phrases that keep the other person talking.



The Four Agreements
    As children, we didn't have the opportunity to choose our beliefs, but we agreed with the information that was passed to us from the dream of the planet via other humans.

    We may have rebelled against them, but we were not strong enough to win the rebellion. The result is **surrender to the beliefs with our agreement**. I call this process the **domestication of humans**. And through this domestication we learn how to live and how to dream.

    **Children are domesticated** the same way that we domesticate a dog, a cat, or any other animal. In order to teach a dog we punish the dog and we give it rewards. We train our children whom we love so much the same way that we train any domesticated animal: with a **system of punishment and reward**. We are told, "You're a good boy," or "You're a good girl.

    **The reward feels good**, and we keep doing what others want us to do in order to get the reward. With that **fear of being punished** and that fear of not getting the reward, we start **pretending to be what we are not**, just to please others.

    After a certain time we are afraid because we know that every time we do something wrong we are going to be punished.

    **We are an autodomesticated animal**. We can now domesticate ourselves according to the same belief system we were given, and using the same system of punishment and reward. We punish ourselves when we don't follow the rules according to our belief system; we reward ourselves when we do.

    There is **something in our minds that judges everybody and everything**, including the weather, the dog, the cat - everything. The inner Judge uses what is in our Book of Law to judge everything we do and don't do, everything we think and don't think, and everything we feel and don't feel. Everything lives under the tyranny of this Judge.

    There is **another part of us that receives the judgments**, and this part is called the Victim. The Victim carries the blame, the guilt, and the shame. It is the part of us that says, "Poor me, I'm not good enough, I'm not intelligent enough, I'm not attractive enough, I'm not worthy of love, poor me."

    Every time we do something that goes against the Book of Law, the Judge says we are guilty, we need to be punished, we should be ashamed. This happens many times a day, day after day, for all the years of our lives. And this is all based on a belief system that we never chose to believe.

    Death is not the biggest fear we have; our biggest fear is taking the risk to be alive. The risk to be alive and express what we really are.

    We have learned to live by other people's points of view because of the fear of not being accepted and of not being good enough for someone else.

    During the process of domestication, we form an image of what perfection is in order to try to be good enough. We create an image of how we should be in order to be accepted by everybody.

    We know we are not what we believe we are supposed to be and so we feel false, frustrated, and dishonest. We try to hide ourselves, and we pretend to be what we are not. The result is that we feel unauthentic and wear social masks to keep others from noticing this.

    **Nobody abuses us more than we abuse ourselves**, and it is the Judge, the Victim, and the belief system that make us do this.

    If someone abuses you a little more than you abuse yourself, you will probably walk away from that person. But if someone abuses you a little less than you abuse yourself, you will probably stay in the relationship and tolerate it endlessly. **The more self-love we have, the less we will experience self-abuse**.

    Self-abuse comes from self-rejection, and self-rejection comes from having an image of what it means to be perfect and never measuring up to that ideal.

    **The most important agreements are the ones you made with yourself**. In these agreements you tell yourself who you are, what you feel, what you believe, and how to behave. The result is what you call your personality.

    We have many agreements that make us suffer, that make us fail in life. If you want to live a life of joy and fulfillment, you have to find the courage to break those agreements that are fear-based and claim your personal power.

    How can we change the entire dream of our life when we have no power to change even the smallest agreement?

    When we are finally ready to change our agreements, there are four very powerful agreements that will help us to break those agreements that come from fear and deplete our energy.

    You will see the drama of hell disappear right before your very eyes. Instead of living in a dream of hell, you will be creating a new dream - your personal dream of heaven.

    First agreement: **Be impeccable with your word**. Word is a sword with two edges, The word is the most powerful tool you have as a human; the word can set you free, or it can enslave you even more than you know.

    Look, this girl is ugly!" The girl listens, believes she is ugly, and grows up with the idea that she is ugly. It doesn't matter how beautiful she is; as long as she has that agreement, she will believe that she is ugly. That is the spell she is under.

    You go against yourself when you judge or blame yourself for anything.

    Being impeccable with your word is not using the word against yourself.

    **Gossip is black magic at its very worst because it is pure poison**. We learned how to gossip by agreement. When we were children, we heard the adults around us gossiping all the time, openly giving their opinions about other people. They even had opinions about people they didn't know.

    Your opinion is nothing but your point of view. It is not necessarily true. Your opinion comes from your beliefs, your own ego, and your own dream.

    Use white magic, beginning with yourself. Tell yourself how wonderful you are, how great you are. Tell yourself how much you love yourself. Use the word to break all those teeny, tiny agreements that make you suffer.

    The second agreement is **don't take anything personally**. Whatever happens around you, don't take it personally. That person tried to send poison to you and if you take it personally, then you take that poison and it becomes yours.

    Immunity to poison in the middle of hell is the gift of this agreement.

    Even the opinions you have about yourself are not necessarily true; therefore, you don't need to take whatever you hear in your own mind personally.

    Do not expect people to tell you the truth because they also lie to themselves.

    If someone is not treating you with love and respect, it is a gift if they walk away from you. Your anger, jealousy, and envy will disappear, and even your sadness will simply disappear if you don't take things personally.

    Third agreement **Don't make assumptions**.  The problem with making assumptions is that we believe they are the truth.

    Making assumptions in relationships leads to a lot of fights, a lot of difficulties, a lot of misunderstandings with people we supposedly love.

    A whole drama is created because we make this assumption and then put more assumptions on top of it.

    we assume they should do, we feel hurt and think, How could you do that?

    We make all sorts of assumptions because we don't have the courage to ask questions.

    We make the assumption that everyone sees life the way we do.

    We have a fear of being ourselves around others. Because we think everyone else will judge us, victimize us, abuse us, and blame us as we do ourselves. So even before others have a chance to reject us, we have already rejected ourselves. That is the way the human mind works. We also

    We have to be what we are, so we don't have to present a false image. If you love me the way I am, "Okay, take me." If you don't love me the way I am, "Okay, bye-bye".

    The fourth agreement is about the action of the first three: **Always do your best**. No more and no less. Your best is never going to be the same from one moment to the next. Just do your best - in any circumstance in your life.

    If you always do your best there is no way you can judge yourself. And if you don't judge yourself there is no way you are going to suffer from guilt, blame, and self-punishment. By always doing your best, you will break a big spell that you have been under.

    If we like what we do, if we always do our best, then we are really enjoying life. We are having fun, we don't get bored, we don't have frustrations.

    You do your best because doing your best all the time makes you so happy. When you are doing your best just for the pleasure of doing it, you are taking action because you enjoy the action.

    Inaction is sitting in front of the television every day for years because you are afraid to be alive and to take the risk of expressing what you are.

    I do my best to fulfill the needs of my body. I do my best to give to my body and to receive what my body gives to me.

    By doing your best, the habits of misusing your word, taking things personally, and making assumptions will become weaker and less frequent with time. You don't need to judge yourself, feel guilty, or punish yourself if you cannot keep these agreements. If you're doing your best, you will feel good about yourself even if you still make assumptions.

    Practice makes the master. By doing your best you become a master. Action is what makes the difference.

    You learned to write, to drive, and even to walk by repetition.

    use every moment to be happy, to do what we really enjoy doing.

    The parasite wants us to carry the past with us and that makes it so heavy to be alive. When we try to live in the past, how can we enjoy the present? When we dream of the future, why must we carry the burden of the past? When are we going to live in the present? That is what the angel of death teaches us to do.




The Man's Guide to Women

    The number one thing women look for is simply this: **trustworthiness**. What trustworthiness looks like is: you are who you say you are and you do what you say you are going to do. It's about reliability, accountability, and showing up just as you are

    She's asking herself, even if she's not consciously thinking about it: **Is he safe**? Will he be there for me? Is he dependable? Is he trustworthy? Opening a door for her, pulling out her chair, and walking on the traffic side of the street signal that you care about her and are willing to protect her. By showing up on time and doing what you say you'll do, you tell her, "Hey, you can trust me."

    Women have **two major complaints about men**. The first complaint is: "He is **never there for me**." The second complaint is: "There **isn't enough intimacy and connection**."
    All women are unique.

    **Attune women's emotions** instead of dismissing them: Give your undivided attention when it's needed. Attention equals affection. Attention ultimately is how you express love.

    Women want men who are there for them when they need them. They want men who are interested in them and who care about them.

    **When in an argument**: No matter what she is saying, the goal is understanding. Turn. Toward. Your. Partner. Face-to-face and eyeball-to-eyeball. Don't offer a solution, don't try to distract her, don't think of how you can "fix" the problem, don't make jokes, and don't minimize the problem. Ask questions about what she is feeling and what it all means to her. It's not about saying "I understand"; it's about showing genuine interest and attempting to understand why this is important to her. Non defensively listen. If you are paying attention, turning toward her, and seeking understanding, you are well on your way down the path of non-defensive listening. Listen twice as much as you speak.

    The men who were able to "downregulate" their anger (calm themselves down and not overreact), were the men with great relationships.

    Attuning with how she feels doesn't mean that you agree with everything that she says, just that you hear her-that **you get it**.

    **Empathize**: Understanding is an intellectual pursuit, while **empathy is an emotional pursuit**. Try to feel how a woman is feeling, regardless of whether-in your opinion-it has any Vulcan logic to it.

    You can ask her how she feels (genius). You can also read her body language.

    Let her know that you value how she feels and that it makes sense to you that she would feel this way.

    The emotional part of the brain calms down when it feels connected to another person and not alone. Show empathy.

    Asking questions is sexier than broadcasting. **Being genuinely interested in her** is much more important than trying to be interesting to her.

    If you use your voice or your size to intimidate or to make a point, even if you don't intend to do this, a woman will not feel physically safe with you and will not trust you completely.


    A man wants to be desired and to feel like the woman in his life wants him, adores him, and approves of him just the way he is. It's no secret.

    Emotions are not a problem for girls. They are a good thing, an opportunity for intimacy.


    A kid named Brian started to cry while playing a game because he doesn't have the ball. So they give it to him. And they were off. Problem solved. Emotions dealt with. The goal of the boys was to keep the ball in play no matter what the cost. Emotions just got in the way of the game. The goal was to get rid of the leech and continue the play. This seems to be true of males whether they are 8 or 48.

    Kathy explains that she wanted Lisa to wear the same barrette in her hair that Kathy had on, is going to be at, and discuss what they might do together during the sleepover. They decide to one day marry brothers, so they can become sisters. To girls, expressing the feelings requires taking a risk, opening up, and trusting one another. **The solution, if they ever determine one, is not even important**.

    For a woman, there are no negative emotions. Emotions just are. For women, they're as natural as breathing. **Emotions are opportunities for intimacy**.

    Women are more complicated rhythmically than men, as their hormone levels rise and fall during each month with their menstrual cycles.
        During the first 2 weeks of the menstrual cycle (when estrogen is peaking), women are friendlier, more talkative, more socially relaxed, calmer, and more emotionally sensitive.
        During the second 2 weeks of the menstrual cycle (when progesterone is peaking), women can be more irritable, more stressed, and less calm, plus they want to be alone more.
        At ovulation, women may be more emotional and possibly more interested in sex,


    Sounds to me like you're feeling really sad at the moment. Talk to me. I want to hear what you're thinking and feeling right now.


    Women tend to be somewhat more attracted to aggressive (alpha) men when they are ovulating and more attracted to kinder, gentler, more nurturing (beta) men when they are not.

    She may want you to take a protector role one day, as the two of you are coming home late from a movie, and on another day, she might want you to take a nurturer role by cuddling up with her on the couch and talking about, you know, feelings.

    Women will be attracted to the expertise you demonstrate in your particular area of interest. Women are attracted to men who are the CEO and president of themselves.

    There is a **big difference between confidence and arrogance**. Confidence will attract a woman. Arrogance will repel her faster Confidence comes from being secure in your abilities.

    It's the woman who ultimately controls whether or not a man approaches her.

    Attractive is not just about physical features-it is also about your nonverbal cues. **High status, a protector, a provider**.

    What physical features do women find most attractive in a man? The answer is **symmetry**. If the left and right sides of your face match up perfectly, you will most likely be a god


    The men who were successful were **space maximizers**, showing their dominance in the social setting by stretching out their legs, throwing an arm around their chair, or otherwise owning the space they occupied. The person who takes up the most space is considered the socially dominant person

    Women are attracted to confidence.These signals social dominance and will make you more likely to get the go-ahead signal from a woman:

    The men who were successful also made **significantly more glancing behaviors**. This means they looked a women in the eyes and often accompanied that with a smile.

    Never stand with one arm across your torso holding onto your other arm or crossing your legs at the knee-you might be comfortable, but from an evolutionary perspective, you can kiss your offspring goodbye.

    Social dominance is also shown by what researchers call **intragender touching**. This amounts to something as simple as you slapping your buddy on the back or throwing an arm around his shoulders, mano a mano.


    If you are someone who makes random nervous gestures with your hands, you're going to appear less confident, less socially dominant, and therefore less desirable to women.


    Women find **low-stress** men much and calm men more attractive than men with higher levels of cortisol (a stress hormone).


    If she wants you, she will put a bid in your direction. The most common bid is direct eye contact. A smile. Repeatedly glancing at you and away from you. These are the signals; what you do with them is up to you.


    If you choose to approach without having gotten the signal, you are risking a high rejection percentage.

    Women are **attracted to confidence and high status**. Become the best "you" possible and exhibit the nonverbal behaviors that indicate social dominance, such as space maximization, male-to-male touching, relaxation, and looking into her eyes and smiling. Avoid fidgeting, poor posture, folding your arms across your chest, or crossing your legs at the knee.

    She is interested if:
        She repeatedly glances at you and looks away.
        She leans toward you while talking.
        She points in your direction with her leg, foot, or shoulders.
        She plays with or tosses her hair.
        She fidgets with a piece of jewelry (like an earring) or strokes the stem of her glass.

    Signals of disinterest include:
        She doesn't make eye contact (unless she's shy).
        She yawns repeatedly when you talk to her.
        She leans or turns her body away from you.
        She looks over your head or scans the room.
        She tells you she's not interested in you.


    Additionally, you are not helping your cause if:
        You think hygiene and clothing don't matter.
        You think drunkenness is attractive.
        You don't make eye contact or smile at a woman you're interested in.
        Your posture or demeanor indicates weakness or you otherwise look like someone who can't keep her safe.
        You can't differentiate between confidence and arrogance. One is attractive to women; the other is not.


    Women are impressed with a guy who has emotional energy, who is passionate about whatever he's talking about, and who asks questions and really listens to the answers.

    **Conversation**
        Women are looking for transparency and honest conversation.

        if You fail to ask a follow-up question related to her answer that shows you are really listening, guess what happens: She doesn't feel safe.

        Don't hurry her along and don't finish her sentences for her. In other words, don't dominate the conversation.

        Ask her questions about her work, her life, and her interests, and keep it positive. If she starts thinking about negative things, she's going to associate those negative things with you.

    A Hero will follow up with deeper questions: "What made you decide to go into law? What do you love about it?" Listen to her answers and ask follow-up questions.

    Ask her open-ended questions. Open-ended questions are answered with more than a word or two;


    They are invitations. If the work questions seem like they are going nowhere or are not inspiring her to tell you about herself, you can ask another open-ended question: "What do you love to do when you are not working?"


    lower-pitched voices in men are considered more attractive to women, and also that men with deep voices have more children.


    people like people who like them.


    Undivided attention is a powerful aphrodisiac.

    Research shows greater compliance to a request if you have "light tactile contact."

    Touch her forearm for 1 to 2 seconds while you are asking for a dance, or her number, or a date. It's another way of indicating your social status and confidence.

    CEOs with lower voices manage bigger companies and, as a result, make more money. A decrease in voice pitch of 22.1 hertz translates to an increase in company size of $440 million in assets.


    It's not about how much you spend; it's about putting her front and center. You can plan a special date that doesn't cost a lot of money-a picnic, a hike, a trip to a free museum or cultural event. Be creative. Be playful. Plan an adventure.




    Physiological response to fear is quite similar to the physiological response to arousal. The right amygdala-the part of the brain where you most experience fear-is also one part of the brain where you experience sexual arousal. The two can often get confused.


    When you engage in an activity that is new, exciting, or dangerous, the same hormonal brew (dopamine, norepinephrine, and phenylethylamine) gets released as when you fall in love.


    So do something exciting and adventurous together on your date-arouse your central nervous systems and arouse each other.


    Ask her about her interests, her passions, her life dreams, her bucket list. Find out where she's traveled and what she loves to do. Ask her who her best friends are, and find out what they are like and what she loves about them. Ask about her family or pets (if she has any). Ask her where she went to school, and supply open-ended questions about what learning she did that most caught her attention and imagination.


    there's a fine line between interrogation and conversation, so be sure to really listen, rather than have it seem like you are checking off a list of questions


    Body language is still important. Hygiene is also important. Being a gentleman is most important.


    Be prepared to share your own passions, your own interests, and your own life dreams.


    Talk about your best friends, tell her what they're like, and talk about where you have traveled and what you loved and hated about traveling.


    Don't present your differences in a way that devalues her. Don't talk about ex-girlfriends. Don't tell stories that turn you into a victim. Talk about who you are and what you think about where you are going in life.


    **Insecurity is an attraction killer every time**. Don't ask her how she thinks the date is going. Don't ask her if she likes you. You will come off as needy and insecure.


    Create safety in conversations by **being a good listener**.
    Don't:
        You use cheesy pickup lines.
        You make overt sexual innuendoes.
        You dominate the conversation, interrupt her, or
        Only talk about yourself.
        You don't ask questions that will help you get to know her and help her tell her story.
        You think spending a lot of money on a date means you will get laid.
        You don't plan a date that makes her feel special and important.
        You stare at her breasts while she is talking or scan the room checking out other girls when you are with her.






No Rules Rules: Netflix and the Culture of Reinvention
    If you **give employees more freedom** instead of developing processes to prevent them from exercising their own judgment, they will make better decisions and it's easier to hold them accountable. This also makes for a happier, more motivated workforce as well as a more nimble company. But to develop a foundation that enables this level of freedom you need to first increase two other elements: + Build up talent density.

    At most companies, **policies and control processes** are put in place to deal with employees who exhibit sloppy, unprofessional, or irresponsible behavior. But if you avoid or move out these people, you don't need the rules. If you build an organization made up of high performers, you can eliminate most controls. The denser the talent, the greater the freedom you can offer. + Increase candor. Talented employees have an enormous amount to learn from one another.

    We were doing far more work—with 30 percent fewer employees. To my amazement, those same eighty people were getting everything done with a passion that seemed higher than ever.

    If you have a team of five stunning employees and two adequate ones, the adequate ones will sap managers energy, so they have less time for the top performers, reduce the quality of group discussions, lowering the team's overall IQ, force others to develop ways to work around them, reducing efficiency, drive staff who seek excellence to quit, and show the team you accept mediocrity, thus multiplying the problem.

    For top performers, a great workplace isn't about a lavish office, a beautiful gym, or a free sushi lunch. It's about the joy of being surrounded by people who are both talented and collaborative. People who can help you be better. When every member is excellent, performance spirals upward as employees learn from and motivate one another.

    performance—both good and bad—is infectious. If you have adequate performers, it leads many who could be excellent to also perform adequately. And if you have a team consisting entirely of high performers, each pushes the others to achieve more.

    The behavior of the one individual quickly spread to the other group members, even though the groups were together for only forty-five minutes.

    Many weren't great at their jobs in myriad little ways, which suggested to others that mediocre performance was acceptable, and brought down the performance of everyone in the office.

    Netflix promotes not just candid feedback but also frequent feedback: The more people heard what they could do better, the better everyone got at their jobs, the better we performed as a company.

    A **feedback loop** is one of the most effective tools for improving performance. We learn faster and accomplish more when we make giving and receiving feedback a continuous part of how we collaborate. Feedback helps us to avoid misunderstandings, creates a climate of co-accountability, and reduces the need for hierarchy and rules. Frequent candid feedback exponentially magnifies the speed and effectiveness of your team.

    **The Emperor's New ClotheS** The higher you get in an organization, the less feedback you receive, and the more likely you are to "come to work naked"

    Put **feedback on the agenda** of their one-on-one meetings with your staff. Don't just ask for feedback but tell and show your employees it is expected.

    Respond to feedback with a **belonging cue** might be a small gesture, like using an appreciative tone of voice, moving physically closer to the speaker, or looking positively into t   hat person's eyes. Or it might be larger, like thanking that person for their courage and speaking about that courage in front of the larger team.

    Giving feedback in order to get frustration off your chest, intentionally hurting the other person, or furthering your political agenda is not tolerated.

    **Feedback must be actionable** must focus on what the recipient can do differently. Wrong feedback to me in Cuba would have been to stop at the comment, "Your presentation is undermining its own messages." Right feedback was, "The way you ask the audience for input is resulting in only Americans participating." Even better would have been: "If you can find a way to solicit contributions from other nationalities in the room your presentation will be more powerful."

    **Receiving Feedback** Appreciate, accept or discard: You will receive lots of feedback. You are not required to follow it. Say "thank you" with sincerity.

    Get rid of jerks as you instill a culture of candor.

    If everyone gives and receives a lot of feedback, the boss is no longer the primary individual to correct an employee's undesirable behavior.

    In the information age, **what matters is what you achieve**, not how many hours you clock, especially for the employees of creative companies like Netflix.

    **Act in Netflix's best interest** That freedom enables to use good judgment to do what was right for the company. But freedom isn't the only benefit of removing your expense policy. The second benefit is that the lack of process speeds everything up.
    When you offer freedom, even if you set context and clarify the ramifications of abuse, **a small percentage of people will cheat the system**. Don't overreact and create more rules. Just deal with the individual situation and move forward.

    When you set rules some people will **take advantage of them**. Some expenses may increase with freedom. But the costs from overspending are not nearly as high as the gains that freedom provides.

    For any type of **operational role**, where there was a clear cap on how good the work could be, we would pay middle of market rate. For all **creative jobs** we would pay one incredible employee at the top of her personal market, instead of using that same money to hire a dozen or more adequate performers.

    Managing mediocre-performing employees is harder and more time consuming.

    The entire **bonus system** is based on the premise that you can set an objective at any given moment that will continue to be important down the road. Doesn't apply at Netflix, where we have to **adapt direction quickly in response to rapid changes**. High performers don't work harder for getting a bonus.

    **High performers naturally want to succeed** and will devote all resources toward doing so whether they have a bonus hanging in front of their nose or not.

    It costs a lot more to lose people and to recruit replacements than to overpay a little in the first place.

    Employees are right to **go interview at a competitor** to find out what his worth is.

    If someone is fired because an incident at work, everyone should be informed. But if it's an employee's personal situation, it's up to that person to share details if he chooses.

    Steve Ballmer, the Microsoft CEO at the time, is this big, boisterous, friendly guy. He would talk very transparently about his mistakes, saying stuff like: "Look here, see how I really screwed this thing up." This led me to feel connected to him. What an honest thoughtful guy! And I realized: oh, it's just normal human behavior to feel more trusting of someone who is open about mistakes.

    Since then, every time I feel I've made a mistake, I talk about it fully, publicly, and frequently. I quickly came to see the biggest advantage of **sunshining a leader's errors** is to encourage everyone to think of making mistakes as normal.

    **Humility** is important in a leader and role model. When you succeed, speak about it softly or let others mention it for you. But when you make a mistake say it clearly and loudly, so that everyone can learn and profit from your errors. In other words, **Whisper wins and shout mistakes.**

    In some industries, preventing error is essential. We are in a creative market. Our big threat in the long run is not making a mistake, it's lack of innovation.

    Our risk is **failing to come up with creative ideas** for how to entertain our customers, and therefore becoming

    We now say that it is disloyal to Netflix when you disagree with an idea and do not express that disagreement. By withholding your opinion, you are implicitly choosing to not help the company.

    **Farming for dissent**: We have developed multiple systems to make sure dissent gets heard.

    I learned that **getting it perfect doesn't matter**. What matters is moving quickly and learning from what we're doing.

    If you make a big deal about a bet that didn't work out, you'll shut down all future risk-taking. People will learn that you preach but don't practice dispersed decision-making.

    We talk about sunshining our failed bets at Netflix, which means talking openly and publicly about things that go wrong. **Ask what we'd learned**.

    When you sunshine your failed bets, everyone wins. You win because people learn they can trust you to tell the truth and to take responsibility for your actions. The team wins because it learns from the lessons that came out of the project. And the company wins because everyone sees clearly that failed bets are an inherent part of an innovative success wheel.

    business leaders are continually telling their employees, "We are a family." But a high-talent-density work environment is not a family. The family represents belonging, comfort, and commitment to helping one another over the long term.

    If a person in your team were to quit tomorrow, would you try to change their mind? of would you accept their resignation? If the later, you should give them now a severance package.

    We are very careful to not have any firing quotas or ranking system. Rank-and-yank or "you must let go of X percent of your people" is just the type of rule-based process that we try to avoid.

    There is no fixed number of slots. Our sport isn't being played to a rule book and we don't have limits on how many people we play with. One employee doesn't have to lose for the other to win. On the contrary, the more excellence we have on the team, the more we accomplish. The more we accomplish, the more we grow. The more we grow, the more positions we add to our roster. The more positions we add, the more space there is for high-performing talent.

    The best response after something difficult happens is to shine a bright light on the situation so everyone can work through it in the open. When you choose to sunshine exactly what happened, your clarity and openness will wash away the fears of the group. Let's pick

    **Keeper Test**: Which of my people, if they told me they were leaving for a similar job at another company, would I fight hard to keep?

    Avoid stack-ranking systems, as they create internal competition and discourage collaboration.

    When an employee is let go, speak openly about what happened with your staff and answer their questions candidly. This will diminish their fear of being next and increase their trust in the company and its managers.

    **Only say about someone what you will say to their face.** The less we talk about people behind their backs, the more we eliminate the gossip that creates inefficiency and bad feelings—and the more we can wash our hands of the unpleasantness generally referred to as "office politics."

    I want people to receive feedback not just from their direct managers but from anyone who has feedback to provide.

    Give one another feedback following the "Start, Stop, Continue" method

    Performance reviews are not the best mechanism for a candid work environment, primarily because the feedback usually goes only one way (down) and comes from only one person (the boss).

    **Lead with context, not control**. You provide all of the information you can so that your team members make great decisions and accomplish their work without oversight or process controlling their actions. The benefit is that the person builds the decision-making muscle to make better independent decisions in the future. Leading with context won't work unless you have the right conditions in place.

    If your focus is on eliminating mistakes, then control is best.

    Loose coupling works only if there is a clear, shared context between the boss and the team. That alignment of context drives employees to make decisions that support the mission and strategy of the overall organization.

    **Highly aligned, loosely coupled**: When one of your people does something dumb don't blame them. Instead ask yourself what context you failed to set. Are you articulate and inspiring enough in expressing your goals and strategy? Have you clearly explained all the assumptions and risks that will help your team to make good decisions? Are

    In order to lead with context, you need to have high talent density, your goal needs to be innovation (not error prevention), and you need to be operating in a loosely coupled system. Once these elements are in place, instead of telling people what to do, get in lockstep alignment by providing and debating all the context that will allow them to make good decisions. When one of your people does something dumb, don't blame that person. Instead, ask yourself what context you failed to set. Are you articulate and inspiring enough in expressing your goals and strategy? Have you clearly explained all the assumptions and risks that will help your team to make good decisions? Are you and your employees highly aligned on vision and objectives? A loosely coupled organization should resemble a tree rather than a pyramid. The boss is at the roots, holding up the trunk of senior managers who support the outer branches where decisions are made. You know you're successfully leading with context when your people are moving the team in the desired direction by using the information they've received from you and those around you to make great decisions themselves.

    How has the onboarding process been and are there any changes I can make in my approach to be a more effective manager to you?

    My feedback to you is that when I send out meeting agendas in the future, you can add anything you like to the list of topics to discuss.

    The comments were frank and well-constructed. Their recommendations were actionable, and they didn't pull punches.

    If the work has been overall good I state that enthusiastically up front. Then I ease into the feedback with "a few suggestions." Then I wrap up by stating, "This is just my opinion, for whatever it is worth," and "You can take it or leave it."

    **The 4As**
        Aim to assist
        Actionable
        Appreciate
        Accept or decline
    Plus one makes 5: Adapt your delivery and your reaction to the culture you're working with to get the results that you need.

    We are **constantly debating our culture** and expecting it will continually evolve. To build a team that is innovative, fast, and flexible, keep things a little bit loose. Welcome constant change. Operate a little closer toward the edge of chaos.


The Psychology of Money: Timeless lessons on wealth, greed, and happiness
    Financial outcomes are driven by **luck, independent of intelligence and effort**.

    **Financial success** is not a hard science. It's a soft skill, where **how you behave is more important** than what you know. I call this soft skill the psychology of money.

    Buying a **lottery ticket** is the only time in our lives we can hold a tangible dream of getting the good stuff that you already have and take for granted. We are paying for a dream, and you may not understand that because you are already living a dream. That's why they buy more tickets than you do.

    The hardest financial skill is **getting the goalpost to stop moving**. Social comparison is the problem here.

    There are many things never worth risking, no matter the potential gain.

    Good investing isn't necessarily about earning the highest returns, because the highest returns tend to be one-off hits that can't be repeated. It's about **earning pretty good returns that you can stick with and which can be repeated for the longest period of time**. That's when compounding runs wild.

    Compounding doesn't rely on earning big returns. Merely **good returns sustained uninterrupted for the longest period of time**.

    How you behaved as an investor during a few months in late 2008 and early 2009 will likely have more impact on your lifetime returns than everything you did from 2000 to 2008.

    Your success as an investor will be determined by how you respond to punctuated moments of terror, not the years spent on cruise control.

    A good definition of an investing genius is the man or woman who can do the average thing when all those around them are going crazy.

    The highest form of wealth is the ability to wake up every morning and say, "I can do whatever I want today.". Having a **strong sense of controlling one's life** is a more dependable predictor of positive feelings of wellbeing than any of the objective conditions of life we have considered. More than your salary.

    **Control over doing what you want, when you want to, with the people you want to**, is the broadest lifestyle variable that makes people happy.

    We've used our greater wealth to buy bigger and better stuff. But we've simultaneously given up more control over our time.

    You might be on the clock for fewer hours than you would in 1950. But it feels like you're working 24/7.

    No one—not a single person out of a thousand—said that to be happy you should:
        Try to work as hard as you can to make money to buy the things you want
        It's important to be at least as wealthy as the people around you, and if you have more than they do Choose your work based on your desired future earning power.
    What they did value were things like **quality friendships, being part of something bigger than themselves, and spending quality, unstructured time with their children**.

    When you see **someone driving a nice car**, you rarely think, "Wow, the guy driving that car is cool." Instead, you think, "Wow, if I had that car people would think I'm cool."

    People tend to want wealth to signal to others that they should be liked and admired. But in reality those other people often bypass admiring you, not because they don't think wealth is admirable, but because **they use your wealth as a benchmark for their own desire to be liked and admired**.

    Money has many ironies. Here's an important one: **Wealth is what you don't see**: It is the nice cars not purchased. The diamonds not bought. The watches not worn, the clothes forgone and the first-class upgrade declined. Wealth is financial assets that haven't yet been converted into the stuff you see. That's not how we think about wealth, because **you can't contextualize what you can't see**.

    When most people say they want to be a millionaire, what they might **actually mean is "I'd like to spend a million dollars."** And that is literally the opposite of being a millionaire. The only way to be wealthy is to not spend the money that you do have.

    Wealth is an option not yet taken to buy something later. Its value lies in offering you options, flexibility, and growth to one day purchase more stuff than you could right now.

    **Savings without a spending goal** gives you options and flexibility, the ability to wait and the opportunity to pounce. It gives you time to think. It lets you change course on your own terms.

    Savings in the bank that earn 0% interest might actually generate an extraordinary return if they give you the flexibility to take a job with a lower salary but more purpose, or wait for investment opportunities that come when those without flexibility turn desperate.

    People do not want the mathematically optimal strategy. They want the strategy that maximizes for how well they sleep at night.

    A trap many investors fall into is what I call "historians as prophets" fallacy: An overreliance on past data as a signal to future conditions in a field where innovation and change are the lifeblood of progress.

    History can be a misleading guide to the future of the economy and stock market because it doesn't account for structural changes that are relevant to today's world.

    But since economies evolve, recent history is often the best guide to the future, because it's more likely to include important conditions that are relevant to the future.

    Realizing that you don't need a specific reason to save. It's fine to save for a car, or a home, or for retirement. But it's equally important to save for things you can't possibly predict or even comprehend—the financial equivalent of field mice.

    Predicting what you'll use your savings for assumes you live in a world where you know exactly what your future expenses will be, which no one does.

    once you write that mission statement down you realize everything that's unrelated to it—what the market did this year, or whether we'll have a recession next year—is part of a game I'm not playing. So I don't pay attention to it,

    If you want to do better as an investor, the single most powerful thing you can do is **increase your time horizon**. Time is the most powerful force in investing. It makes little things grow big and big mistakes fade away. It can't neutralize luck and risk, but it pushes results closer towards what people deserve.

    Use money to gain control over your time, because not having control of your time is such a powerful and universal drag on happiness.

    The ability to do what you want, when you want, with who you want, for as long as you want to, pays the highest dividend that exists in finance.

    **Be nicer and less flashy**. No one is impressed with your possessions as much as you are. You might think you want a fancy car or a nice watch. But what you probably want is respect and admiration. And

    True success is exiting some rat race to modulate one's activities for peace of mind.




The Whole-Brain Child: 12 Revolutionary Strategies to Nurture Your Child's Developing Mind
    Most likely you want **your children to be happy, independent, and successful. You want them to enjoy fulfilling relationships and **live a life full of meaning and purpose**.

    What percentage of your time you spend intentionally developing these qualities in your children.

    You can use all of the interactions you share: the stressful, angry ones as well as the miraculous, adorable ones—as opportunities to help them become the responsible, caring, capable people you want them to be. That's what this book is about: **using those everyday moments with your kids to help them reach their true potential**.

    By understanding a few simple and easy-to-master basics about how the brain works, you'll be able to better understand your child, respond more effectively to difficult situations, and build a foundation for social, emotional, and mental health.


    Parts of the brain
        **Left side** of the brain that helps you think logically and organize thoughts into sentences
        **Right side** that helps you experience emotions and read nonverbal cues.
        You also have a **"reptile brain"** that allows you to act instinctually and make split-second survival decisions
        And a **"mammal brain"** that leads you toward connection and relationships.

    The key to thriving is to help these parts work well together—to integrate them. Integration takes the distinct parts of your brain and helps them work together as a whole.

    Your left brain loves and desires order. It is logical, literal, linguistic (it likes words), and linear (it puts things in a sequence or order).

    The right brain, on the other hand, is holistic and nonverbal, sending and receiving signals that allow us to communicate, such as facial expressions, eye contact, tone of voice, posture, and gestures. Instead of details and order, our right brain cares about the big picture—the meaning and feel of an experience—and specializes in images, emotions, and personal memories. We get a "gut feeling" or "heart-felt sense" from our right brain. Some say the right brain is more intuitive and emotional.

    Very young children are right-hemisphere dominant, especially during their first three years. They haven't mastered the ability to use logic and words to express their feelings, and they live their lives completely in the moment Logic, responsibilities, and time don't exist for them yet. But when a toddler begins asking "Why?" all the time, you know that the left brain is beginning to really kick in.

    In order to live balanced, meaningful, and creative lives full of connected relationships, it's crucial that our two hemispheres work together.

    When a child is upset, logic often won't work until we have responded to the right brain's emotional needs.

    Hours of screen time—playing video games, watching television, texting—will wire the brain in certain ways. Educational activities, sports, and music will wire it in other ways. Spending time with family and friends and learning about relationships, especially with face-to-face interactions, will wire it in yet other ways. Everything that happens to us affects the way the brain develops.

    That's what we want to do for each of our kids: help their brain become more integrated so they can use their mental resources to full capacity.


    A person's brain isn't considered fully developed until she reaches her mid-twenties.

    So one extreme is chaos, where there's a total lack of control. The other extreme is rigidity, where there's too much control, leading to a lack of flexibility and adaptability. We all move back and forth between these two banks as we go through our days—especially as we're trying to survive parenting.


    Chaos and rigidity arise when integration is blocked.


    When she is in a state of integration: she is flexible, adaptive, stable, and able to understand herself and the world around her.

    As a partent, are you too right-brain dominant? maybe your tendency is to live in a left-brain emotional desert, so you are rigid in your reactions and have a hard time reading and responding to your children's emotions and needs?


    downstairs brain is primitive, the upstairs brain is highly sophisticated, controlling some of your most important higher-order and analytical thinking.

    responsible for producing many of the characteristics we hope to see in our kids: Sound decision making and planning Control over emotions and body Self-understanding Empathy Morality A child whose upstairs brain is properly functioning will demonstrate some of the most important characteristics of a mature and healthy human being.

    when a child's upstairs brain is working well, she can regulate her emotions, consider consequences, think before acting, and consider how others feel—all

    a person's brain works best when the upstairs and downstairs are integrated with each other. So a parent's goal should be to help build and reinforce the metaphorical stairway

    the upstairs can monitor the actions of the downstairs and help calm the strong reactions, impulses, and emotions that originate there.

    kids are prone to getting "trapped downstairs," without the use of their upstairs brain, which results in them flying off the handle, making poor decisions, and showing a general lack of empathy and self-understanding.



    The most important "we" in your life as a parent is **the relationship you share with your child**. That relationship significantly impacts your child's future.

    Research studies have consistently shown that when parents offer repeated, predictable experiences in which they **see and sensitively respond to their children's emotions and needs**, their children will thrive—socially, emotionally, physically, and even academically.

    imagine your child holding his child, and realize **the power of what you are passing on**. And it won't stop there. Your grandchildren can take what they learn from their parents and pass it further along as a continuing legacy of joy and happiness.

    whole-brain perspective is that it lets you understand that even the mistakes are opportunities




    **1. Left + right = clarity and understanding**: Help your kids use both the logical left brain and the emotional right brain as a team. What you can do:
Then tell the story. With small children, you'll need to be the primary narrator. Use your words and even act out the fall or the bump, possibly using humor, and watch your child's fascination. It can be helpful to make a homemade book with pictures or photos to retell an upsetting story, or to prepare your child for a transition, like a new bedtime routine or starting preschool.

    Find ways to let your child use her upstairs brain and **make decisions for herself**. Do you want to wear your blue or red shirt today? Would you like milk or water with dinner? When you read together, ask brain-growing questions: How do you think the kitty will get down from the tree? Why does the girl look sad?

    **2. Connect and redirect** When your child is upset, connect first emotionally, right brain to right brain. Then, once your child is more in control and receptive, bring in the left-brain lessons and discipline.

    "connect and redirect" method, and it begins with helping our kids "feel felt" before we try to solve problems or address the situation logically.

        Step 1: Connect with the Right: Nonverbal signals like physical touch, empathetic facial expressions, a nurturing tone of voice, and nonjudgmental listening.

        Step 2: Redirect with the Left: Then she could begin to appeal to her son's left brain and address the specific issues he had raised. In other words, then it was time for step 2, which helps to integrate the left and the right. Redirect him by logically explaining how hard she works to be fair, by promising to leave a note while he slept, and by strategizing with him about his next birthday and about how to make homework more fun.



    **3. Name it to tame it** When big, right-brain emotions are raging out of control, help your kids tell the story about what's upsetting them, so their left brain can help make sense of their experience and they can feel more in control (integrating the upstairs brain and the downstairs brain).

    When your child is upset, make sure to acknowledge his feelings. This should always be your first move. But then, as quickly as possible, get him moving. Roughhouse with him. Play follow the leader. Race him to his bedroom and back. Get him to move and you'll change his mood.

    Whatever behavior is inappropriate in your family—being disrespectful, hurting someone, throwing things—should remain off-limits even in moments of high emotion. You may need to stop destructive behavior and remove your child from the situation before you begin to connect and redirect.

    It's generally a good idea to discuss misbehavior and its consequences after the child has calmed down, since moments of emotional flooding are not the best times for lessons to be learned.

    Nobody likes to be told no, and it's an especially ineffective strategy to use too often with toddlers. When possible, avoid outright power struggles with your little one. Save your no for when you really need it. The next time you hear yourself beginning to forbid her from hitting the mirror with the stick, stop. Instead, engage her upstairs brain: Let's go outside. What could you do with that stick in the yard?

    Some of the best conversations with children take place while something else is happening.

    Children are much more apt to share and talk while building something, playing cards, or riding in the car than when you sit down and look them right in the face and ask them to open up.



    **Develop the upstairs brain** Watch for ways to help build the sophisticated upstairs brain, which is "under construction" during childhood and adolescence and can be "hijacked" by the downstairs brain, especially in high-emotion situations.

    Children this small may not know about a remote, but they know the power of a story. Enjoy this time when your child wants to tell (and retell) stories. Rather than pausing and fast-forwarding, you may end up simply pressing play repeatedly as you tell the same story multiple times. Even if you feel annoyed at having to go over the account again and again, remember that storytelling produces understanding, healing, and integration.

    **Engage, don't enrage** In high-stress situations, engage your child's upstairs brain, rather than triggering the downstairs brain. Don't immediately play the "Because I said so!" card. Instead, ask questions, request alternatives, even negotiate.

    At this age, ask simple questions, focusing on returning your child's attention to the details of her day. We went to Carrie's house today, didn't we? And do you remember what we did there? Questions like these are the building blocks for an integrated memory system.

    Two different types of tantrums. An upstairs tantrum occurs when a child essentially decides to throw a fit. She makes a conscious choice to act out, to push buttons and terrorize you until she get what she wants. She is able to control her emotions and body, to be logical and make good decisions. Basic necessities get taken care of downstairs.

    **The amygdala's job** is to quickly process and express emotions, especially anger and fear. Isn't usually so good in normal, everyday situations, like when we storm from our car and yell at another parent for breaking the no-waiting rule. That's what we call **"flipping our lid,"** and it's how the amygdala can get us into trouble: it takes over and relieves the upstairs brain from its duties. When we're not truly in danger, we want to think before acting, instead of the other way around. We want our kids to do the same.

    The tantrum can be one of the most unpleasant parts of parenting. A parent who recognizes an upstairs tantrum is left with one clear response: never negotiate with a terrorist. An upstairs tantrum calls for firm boundaries and a clear discussion about appropriate and inappropriate behavior.

    A good response in this situation would be to calmly explain, "I understand that you're excited about the slippers, but I don't like the way you're acting. If you don't stop now, you won't get the slippers, and I'll need to cancel your playdate this afternoon, because you're showing me that you're not able to handle yourself well."


    **4. Use it or lose it** Provide lots of opportunities to exercise the upstairs brain. Play "What would you do?" games, and avoid rescuing kids from difficult decisions.

    Lay the foundation for an awareness of the difference between "feel" and "am." When young children feel sad (or angry or afraid), they have a hard time understanding that they won't always feel that way. So help them say, "I feel sad right now, but I know I'll be happy later." Be careful, though, that you don't dismiss the actual feelings. Acknowledge the present emotion and provide comfort, then help your child understand that he won't feel sad forever, that he will feel better soon.

    Then she asked her daughter to work with her to be a problem solver. Once the girl asks, "How do we do that?" the mother knows that the upstairs brain is engaged.

    The upstairs brain is like a muscle: when it gets used, it develops, gets stronger, and performs better. And when it gets ignored, it doesn't develop optimally,

    One big parental temptation is to make decisions for our kids, so that they consistently do the right thing. But as often as possible, we need to give them practice at making decisions for themselves.

    For very young children, this can be as simple as asking, "Do you want to wear your blue shoes or your white shoes today?" Then, as kids get older, we can give them more responsibility in the decision making and allow them to take on some dilemmas that can really challenge them.


    **5. Move it or lose it** When a child has lost touch with his upstairs brain, help him regain balance by having him move his body.

    Controlling Emotions and the Body Another important—and difficult—task for little ones is to remain in control of themselves.

    Self-understanding One of the best ways to foster self-understanding in your children is to ask questions that help them look beyond the surface of what they understand: Why do you think you made that choice? What made you feel that way? Why do you think you didn't do well on your test—was it because you were hurrying, or is this just really difficult material?

    When your child is old enough to be able to write—or even just draw—you might give him a journal and encourage daily writing or drawing. This ritual can enhance his ability to pay attention to and understand his internal landscape.

    Empathy is another important function of the upstairs brain.

    When you ask simple questions that encourage the consideration of another's feelings, you are building your child's ability to feel empathy.

    The more you give your child's upstairs brain practice at thinking of others, the more capable he will be of having compassion.

    Leaving the store: "That woman wasn't very nice to us, was she? Do you think something might have happened to her that made her feel sad today?"

    All of the above attributes of a well-integrated upstairs brain culminate in one of our most important goals for our children: a strong sense of morality.

    Another way to exercise this part of the brain is to offer hypothetical situations, which kids often love: Would it be OK to run a red light if there was an emergency? If a bully was picking on someone at school and there were no adults around, what would you do? The point is to challenge your children to think about how they act, and to consider the implications of their decisions.

    Doesn't seem fair, does it? Let's go ride our bikes and talk about it. Sometimes just moving your body can help your brain feel like things are going to be OK. However you do it, the point is to help your child regain some sort of balance and control by moving their body, which can remove blockages and pave the way for integration to return.


    **6. Make the implicit explicit** Help your kids make their implicit memories explicit, so that past experiences don't affect them in debilitating ways.

    **Use the remote of the mind** When a child is reluctant to narrate a painful event, the internal remote lets her pause, rewind, and fast-forward a story as she tells it, so she can maintain control over how much of it she views.


    **7. Remember to remember: Help your kids exercise their memory by giving them lots of practice at recalling important events: in the car, at the dinner table, wherever.


    You can use the moments when you feel yourself losing control as opportunities to model self-regulation. Little eyes are watching to see how you calm yourself down. Your actions set an example of how to make a good choice in a high-emotion moment when you're in danger of flipping your lid.

    We encode implicit memory throughout our lives, and in the first eighteen months we encode only implicitly.

    Implicit memory encodes our perceptions, our emotions, our bodily sensations, and, as we get older, behaviors like learning to crawl and walk and ride a bike and eventually change a diaper. What's

    implicit memories cause us to form expectations about the way the world works, based on our previous experiences.

    neurons that fire together wire together, we create certain mental models based on what's gone on in the past. If you hug your toddler every evening when you come home from work, he'll have a model in his mind that your return will be filled with affection and connection.

    implicit memory creates something called "priming" in which the brain readies itself to respond in a certain way.

    Implicit memory is essentially an evolutionary process that keeps us safe and out of danger.

    A more extreme version of this process occurs in the case of post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, where an implicit memory of a disturbing experience becomes encoded in a person's brain,

    the main thing Tina did here was to tell the story of where her son's fears came from. She used narrative to help his implicit memories become explicit and full of meaning, so they wouldn't act on him with such hidden power.

    Unless kids can make sense of their painful memories, they may experience sleep disturbances, debilitating phobias, and other problems.
    **The wheel of awareness: When your kids get stuck on one particular point on the rim of their wheel of awareness, help them choose where they focus their attention so they can gain more control over how they feel.

    Help your child become aware of and talk about her internal world. Ask questions that guide her toward noticing bodily sensations (Are you hungry?), mental images (What do you picture when you think about Grandma's house?), feelings (It's frustrating when the blocks fall, isn't it?), and thoughts (What do you think will happen when Jill comes over tomorrow?).

    help your kids talk about their experiences, so they can integrate their implicit and explicit memories. This is especially important when it comes to the most important and valuable moments of their lives. The more you can help bring those noteworthy moments into their explicit memory—such as family experiences, important friendships, or rites of passage—then the clearer and more influential those experiences will be.

    Just recounting basic facts like this helps develop your child's memory and prepares her for interacting with more significant memories down the road.

    journaling can improve immune and heart function, as well as general well-being.

    **8. Let the clouds of emotion roll by**: Remind kids that feelings come and go; they are temporary states, not enduring traits.

    Even small children can learn to be still and take calm breaths, if only for a few seconds. Have your child lie on her back and place a toy boat on her stomach. Show her how to take slow, big breaths to make the boat go up and down. Keep this exercise very short since she's so young. Just let her experience the feeling of being still, quiet, and peaceful.

    **SIFT**: Help your children pay attention to the Sensations, Images, Feelings, and Thoughts within them.

    We need to help children understand that the clouds of their emotions can (and will) roll on by. They won't feel sad or angry or hurt or lonely forever. This is a difficult concept for kids to understand at first.

    we have to help them understand that feelings are temporary—on average, an emotion comes and goes in ninety seconds.

    they first need to become aware of what it is they are actually experiencing.

    help our children recognize and understand the different rim points of their individual wheel of awareness.

    They can learn to recognize stomach butterflies as markers of anxiety, a desire to hit as anger or frustration, heavy shoulders as sadness, and so on. They can identify tension in their body when they're nervous, then learn to relax their shoulders and take deep breaths to calm themselves. Simply recognizing different sensations like hunger, tiredness, excitement, and grumpiness can give children a great deal of understanding and ultimately influence over their feelings.

    help them be specific, so they can go from vague emotional descriptors like "fine" and "bad" to more precise ones, like "disappointed," "anxious," "jealous," and "excited."

    **9. Exercise mindsight**: Mindsight practices teach children to calm themselves and focus their attention where they want.

    **10. Wired for "we"**: Watch for ways to capitalize on the brain's built-in capacity for social interaction. Create positive mental models of relationships.

    Talk with your child about sharing and taking turns, but don't expect too much from her. In the coming years you will have many opportunities to teach social skills and discipline. Right now, if there's conflict between her and another child, help her express how she feels and how the other child might feel, and help them problem-solve if possible. Then redirect them both so they can transition into a different activity they can each enjoy.

    in our ever-changing modern society, learning to move from "me" to "we" may be essential for how our children will be able to adapt in our future world. Helping children become a participating member of a "we" while not losing touch with their individual "me" is a tall order for any parent.

    But happiness and fulfillment result from being connected to others while still maintaining a unique identity. That's

    studies of happiness and wisdom reveal that a key factor in well-being is devoting one's attention and passions to the benefit of others instead of just focusing on the individual,

    If we want to prepare kids to participate as healthy individuals in a relationship, we need to create within them an open, receptive state, instead of a closed, reactive one.

    **11. Enjoy each other**: Build fun into the family, so that your kids enjoy positive and satisfying experiences with the people they're with the most.

    Follow your child's lead and just play. Tickle him, laugh with him, love him. Stack things up, knock them down. Bang on pots and pans, go to the park, roll the ball. With every interaction in which you focus on and attune to your child, you can create positive expectations in his mind about what it means to love and be in a relationship.

    Tell jokes. Be silly. Take an interest in what they care about. The more they enjoy the time they spend with you and the rest of the family, the more they'll value relationships and desire more positive and healthy relational experiences in the future. The reason is simple. With every fun, enjoyable experience you give your children while they are with the family, you provide them with positive reinforcement about what it means to be in loving relationship with others.



    **12. Connect through conflict**: Instead of an obstacle to avoid, view conflict as an opportunity to teach your kids essential relationship skills, like seeing other people's perspectives, reading nonverbal cues, and making amends.

    Now is the time, as early as possible, to begin teaching your child about emotions. Mirror feelings and use nonverbals (like hugs and empathetic facial expressions) to show that you understand: You're frustrated, aren't you? Then, once you've connected, set the boundary: Biting hurts. Please be gentle. Finally, focus on an appropriate alternative or move on to something else: Hey, there's your bear. I haven't seen him in a long time.

    Repair: Teach Kids to Make Things Right After a Conflict

    Listen to What's Not Being Said: Teach Kids About Nonverbal Communication and Attuning to Others

    after winning a big soccer game, your son might need you to help him notice that his friend on the other team is in need of some cheering up, even if he says he's fine. As evidence, you can point to the friend's body language and facial expressions—the drooping shoulders, the lowered head, the downcast face. By helping your son make these simple observations you'll increase his mindsight, and

    situation might call for a specific,

    Sometimes they need to take steps to right whatever they've done wrong. The situation might call for a specific, direct response: repairing or replacing a broken toy, or helping to rebuild some sort of project. Or a more relational response might be warranted, like drawing the other person a picture, performing an act of kindness, or writing a letter of apology. The point is that you're helping your kids demonstrate acts of love and contrition that show they've thought about another's feelings and want to find a way to repair the rupture in the relationship.

    bring up the question "If it were you and your favorite thing were broken, what would help you feel better?"

    Each new movement toward considering someone else's feelings creates stronger connections in the relational

    "discipline" really means "to teach"—not "to punish." A disciple is a student, not a recipient of behavioral consequences.

    take moments of conflict and transform them into opportunities for learning, skill building, and brain development.
